<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The paucity of war experience since
the introduction of the steam-driven
armoured ship invests the battle of
Tsu-shima with supreme importance.
Between Trafalgar and the 27th May
1905, there had been only two fleet
actions on a large scale—those of Lissa
and of the Yalu—and the first was fought
before the wooden vessel had disappeared
and the rifled gun had become universal.
The various minor engagements which
occurred during this long period were
either destitute of teaching, or failed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
provide an adequate basis for conclusions
capable of serving as guides to a rational
system of tactics or to a scientific shipbuilding
policy.</p>

<p>It has, therefore, followed, in this
country especially, that the evolution
of the warship has been frequently
capricious, indicating the absence of
any clear principles, and entailing an
immense total expenditure upon vessels
unsuited to our national requirements,
but happily not forced to demonstrate
their inutility.</p>

<p>In all wars, whether by sea or land,
some few general lessons stand out unmistakably;
but the difficulty of arriving
at a just estimate of the relative significance
of the causes which have led to
victory or to defeat is always extreme.
Genius, which may be defined as an unerring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
sense of proportion, is necessarily
rare, and the person with an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">idée fixe</i>
in favour of some particular method or
weapon will generally discover, in every
conflict, evidence in support of his faith.
This tendency will be most marked
when national experience of war is lacking,
and we are, therefore, compelled
to draw our inspirations from fighting
carried on by other peoples.</p>

<p>In the long series of wars which
culminated in the Nelson era, broad
principles had been evolved and had
been grasped by the leaders of naval
thought. More than ninety years have
elapsed since the British Navy was
called upon to fight a great fleet action,
and meanwhile technical progress of all
kinds, advancing by giant strides, has
opened out new possibilities tending to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
bewilder the imagination and to invite
mistakes and impolicy.</p>

<p>Even when, as now, valuable war experience
is available, there is always a
risk of false deductions. Conditions differ
so greatly that generalisations based upon
special episodes may be misleading and
even dangerous. Thus the American
Navy and our own have unquestionably
suffered from shallow reasoning derived
from the peculiar operations of the Civil
War. Similarly, the action off Lissa led
to a cult of the ram which has left a
deep impress upon shipbuilding, while a
few isolated successes obtained by torpedoes,
in exceptional circumstances, have
given rise to exaggerated claims on behalf
of this weapon which can only end in
disappointment.</p>

<p>Instances could be multiplied, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
obvious moral is the vital necessity for
the most careful study by the clearest
available brains before translating any
so-called lesson of war into national
policy. In a single year a navy of the
magnitude of our own may be committed
to many millions of expenditure,
the result of which will affect its fighting
efficiency for nearly a quarter of a
century. The vital need for caution
and for profound study of all such
experience as is forthcoming is, therefore,
evident.</p>

<p>The battle of Tsu-shima is by far the
greatest and the most important naval
event since Trafalgar, and the navy
which is able to draw the most accurate
conclusions, technical as well as tactical,
from its experiences and to apply them
in terms of policy and of training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
will secure marked advantage in the
future.</p>

<p>At the battle of the Yalu the Japanese
and Chinese fleets were numerically equal—twelve
ships—but the former had only
three vessels (all under 3000 tons) carrying
side armour, and eight were protected
cruisers.<a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The Chinese, on the other hand,
had five vessels with side armour, including
two battleships, and six protected cruisers.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
In heavy armament the Chinese had a
great superiority, the Japanese having
the advantage in quick-firing guns, as
shown below:</p>

<p class="in0">In heavy guns (9-inch and over) the
Russians had the large preponderance
of 28, the proportion being 45 to 17.
In the smaller types, 4.7-inch to 8-inch,
on the other hand, the Japanese superiority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
was 50, and in the 6-inch Q.F. type
alone it was 58. A fair inference seems
to be that the Japanese secondary armaments
played the most important part in
the first and practically decisive period of
the battle.</p>

<p>In both actions the Japanese had the
highest average speed—about 2 knots at
the battle of the Yalu and much more
at Tsu-shima, where the three Russian
coast-defence ships, the older battleships,
and the three armoured cruisers were poor
steamers. Excluding, on the Russian
side, the <i>Sissoy-Veliki</i>, <i>Navarin</i>, and
<i>Nicolay I.</i>, the difference of average
battleship speed was only 0.6 knots;
but the condition of the Russian vessels
was such that they could not approach
their theoretical maximum.</p>

<p>These were the antecedent technical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
conditions of a great battle which, in
the startling decisiveness of its results,
and in the fact that the victors lost no
ship, challenges comparison with that
of the Nile. The tangled chain of
causation now requires to be unravelled
by the coolest heads at our disposal,
excluding all previous bias, and seeking
only to apportion the true relative
values of the various factors involved
with the single object of securing the
sound direction of future naval policy.</p>

<p>What part did superior speed play
in carrying destruction to the Russian
fleet? What guns established the initial
superiority of fire and wrought the
havoc, moral and material, which ensured
victory? What purpose did armour
serve, and how did its distribution conform
to the needs of the battle? It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
upon the answers to such questions as
these that our naval policy must depend.</p>

<p>Underlying the experience of the
battle of Tsu-shima there are undoubtedly
principles of general application. It is for
us to ascertain those principles, and to
apply them as a test to all ship designs
and tactical theories.</p>

<p>The merit of this little work is that
it records the impressions of a naval
officer who apparently had no official
duties to absorb his attention. Captain
Semenoff had also the advantage of
being present on board the <i>Cesarevitch</i>
at the action of the 10th August 1904,
when it was vital to the Japanese to
take no great risks. He significantly
notes the difference of conditions. At
Tsu-shima, Admiral Togo was determined
to force a decisive action. Moreover, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
Japanese had, meanwhile, improved their
fuses. Thus, in the later action, “shells
seemed to be pouring upon us incessantly....
It seemed as if these were
mines, not shells.... They burst as
soon as they touched anything.... No!
It was different to the 10th August.”</p>

<p>Incidentally the author notes the
“portmanteaus” (Japanese 12-inch shell)
“curving awkwardly head over heels
through the air and falling anyhow on
the water.” This shows that some of the
Japanese 12-inch guns—numbering only
sixteen—were so much worn as to be
unable to give adequate rotation to their
projectiles, which consequently could only
have hit the Russian ships by accident.</p>

<p>The <i>Suvoroff</i>, where Captain Semenoff’s
experiences were gained, was a ship of
13,500 tons, with a continuous armour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
belt 12 feet broad, tapering in length at
the water-line from 8 inches to 6 inches,
and vertically from 6 inches to 4 inches
above. Her heavy armament consisted
of four 12-inch guns in 10-inch turrets,
standing upon 10-inch barbettes built up
from the armoured deck. The secondary
armament of twelve 6-inch guns was
mounted in 6-inch turrets standing upon
6-inch barbettes, all built up from the
upper deck. Below the 6-inch barbettes
were armoured ammunition hoists carried
down to the belt level. A main armoured
deck (3 to 2 inches) at the water-line
level extended all over the ship.</p>

<p>Such was the <i>Suvoroff</i>, which was
driven out of the line in less than forty
minutes, and after being reduced to
the hopeless state described by Captain
Semenoff, was gratuitously torpedoed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
the Japanese. Being the flag-ship of
the Commander-in-Chief she was doubtless
singled out as a target; but, of her
three sister-ships, the <i>Alexander III.</i> was
sunk by gun fire about five hours after
the beginning of the action; the <i>Borodino</i>
also sank in five hours, apparently
as the result of the explosion of a
magazine; and the <i>Orel</i> surrendered on
the 28th with main turrets not seriously
injured and thick armour not penetrated.</p>

<p>The general impression conveyed by
Captain Semenoff, and confirmed from
other sources, is that the Russian ships
were overwhelmed by the volume of
the Japanese fire, and that frequency
of hitting rather than weight of shells
should be the main object. If this conclusion
is correct, the principle which
guided the British Navy in the days of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
Nelson—to close to effective range and
then deliver the most rapid fire possible—has
been strikingly reaffirmed. Effective
ranges have increased; but this
principle remains unchanged and is
probably unchangeable.</p>

<p>The trouble which arose from the
outbreak of fire on board the <i>Suvoroff</i>
and from the wreckage of the bridges
and spar-deck, the men killed in the
conning tower, the penetration of the
armoured deck near the bow, the down-draught
of smoke, the estimate of range
(“a little more than 20 cables”) at a
critical moment—all these points, which
present themselves in the narrative, claim
attention and careful comparison with
other accounts.</p>

<p>Captain Semenoff’s impressions of the
manœuvring of the fleets may well be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
somewhat vague; but it is worth collating
with other observations. Lastly,
the graphic touches of the author show
with painful distinctness the terrible
strain imposed upon human endurance.
Few who read his account of the heroic
signalmen “standing silently and outwardly
calm,” unwilling to go below the
armoured deck, wishing only for orders,
and feeling “themselves indispensable
to the fight,” will be inclined to accept
the recent theory that partly-trained
and half-disciplined men are fit to find
a place on board ship in modern naval
war.</p>

<p>Upon a correct understanding of the
lessons of Tsu-shima the expenditure
of millions of public money and the
efficiency of the Navy in the near future
must mainly depend. If this simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
narrative can, in however small a degree,
help us to attain such an understanding,
its publication will be abundantly
justified.</p>

<p>The following account of the battle of
Tsu-shima, fought on 27th May 1905,
is a translation of the narrative of
Captain Vladimir Semenoff, a Russian
naval officer who was on board the
flag-ship (<i>Knyaz Suvoroff</i>) during the
engagement. It is of more than usual
interest, as the writer had previously
served in the <i>Cesarevitch</i> at Port Arthur,
and had taken part in the disastrous sally
from that port on 10th August 1904.</p>

<p>At the great battle of which he now
relates his experiences, he was present
in an unofficial capacity, which gave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
unlimited opportunity for observation.
Moreover, the fact of his being able to
make a series of notes at the time (till
too seriously wounded) puts an additional
stamp of reality on to his already most
graphic account.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the
Russian Baltic fleet—Russia’s final and
supreme appeal to the God of Battles—left
Cronstadt for the Far East on 11th
September 1904, and during all the long
months till the following May was
slowly making its way, <i>viâ</i> the Cape of
Good Hope, to Japanese waters. The
difficulties encountered during that prolonged
voyage were enormous. The
nerves of officers and men, who constantly
apprehended attempts to destroy
the fleet, were in a continual state of
tension: news of the outside world and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
especially of events in the Far East was
practically unobtainable: and yet officers
and men, despite the additional disadvantage
of having to take their ships
into action after these many months at
sea, fearlessly entered into an engagement
which they knew meant death, and
fought their ships with a self-devotion
and courage which has earned for them
the admiration of the world.</p>

<p>Admiral Togo—flying his flag on the
<i>Mikasa</i>—awaited the enemy in Japanese
waters. His fleet, which, since the fall of
Port Arthur on 2nd January 1905, had
been relieved of its blockading duties,
had spent the intervening months in
repairing damage and bringing itself up
to the highest state of preparation in
expectation of the coming of the Baltic
fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>
To a nation like ourselves, whose first
line of defence is the Navy, I venture to
think that these pages will give food for
thought, as, besides enabling the reader
to see the paralysing and awful effect
of high explosives thrown on board
a modern battleship in action, they
supply us with a picture of what a
losing engagement means to those who
lose.</p>

<p>When first I took up the original
volume I read it merely with a view to
extracting information <i>re</i> fire effect, gun
power, weather conditions, formations,
and other factors complementary to the
result of the battle. But the narrative
appeared so realistic that the thought
occurred to me to place the following
translation before the public.</p>

<p>The speed maintained by the opposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
fleets during the battle is shown in the
diagram attached. Dates have been
expressed according to the English
calendar (which is thirteen days in
advance of the Russian)—otherwise the
writer’s own words and colloquial style
have, as far as possible, been faithfully
adhered to, to the detriment of literary
style in translating.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that this narrative
comes as a supplement to the very
interesting account by Politovsky of the
voyage of the Baltic fleet to the Far
East—recently translated by Major
Godfrey and published by John Murray
under the title “From Libau to Tsu-shima.”</p>

<p>Politovsky went down in the <i>Suvoroff</i>,
and his story ends with the arrival of
the fleet at Shanghai on 23rd May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>
the date on which he posted his last
letter to Russia. The following narrative
commences on 25th May, as the fleet
swung out of Shanghai to meet its
destiny.</p>

<p class="p2 center">In memory of the <i>Suvoroff</i>!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I" class="nobreak p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>A fresh breeze mournfully droned
through the wire rigging and angrily
dispersed the ragged, low-lying clouds.
The troubled waters of the Yellow Sea
splashed against the side of the battleship,
while a thin, cold, blinding rain
fell, and the raw air penetrated to
one’s very bones. But a group of
officers still stood on the after-bridge,
watching the silhouettes of the transports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
slowly disappearing in the rain
haze.</p>

<p>On their masts and yard-arms signals
were being flown, the last messages
and final requests of those who had
been our fellow-travellers on the long
tedious voyage.</p>

<p>Why is it that at sea a friendly
greeting of this kind, expressed merely
by a combination of flags, touches one’s
heart so deeply, and speaks to it even
more than salutes, cheers, or music?
Why is it that until the signal has
been actually hauled down every one
looks at it, silently and intently, as if
real words, instead of motley-coloured
pieces of cloth, were fluttering in the
breeze, and becoming wet with rain?
Why is it that on the signal being
hauled down every one turns away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
quietly moving off to his duty, as
if the last quiet handshake had been
given, and “good-bye” had been said
for ever?</p>

<p>“Well!—how about the weather?”
said some one—to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Grand,” answered another with a
smile. “If we get this all the way to
Vladivostok, then thank the Lord!
why, a general battle will be impossible.”</p>

<p>Once more a signal was made to the
fleet, and, having cast off the majority<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
of our transports at Shanghai, we take
up our fresh and <em>last</em> “order of march.”</p>

<p>Ahead, in wedge formation, was the
scout division consisting of three ships—the
<i>Svietlana</i>, <i>Almaz</i>, and <i>Ural</i>; next
came the fleet in two columns. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
starboard column consisted of the 1st
and 2nd armoured squadrons, <i>i.e.</i> eight
ships—the <i>Suvoroff</i>, <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Borodino</i>,
<i>Orel</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> <i>Sissoy</i>, <i>Navarin</i>, <i>Nakhimoff</i>. On
the port side were the 3rd armoured
and cruiser squadrons, <i>i.e.</i> eight ships—the
<i>Nicolay</i>, <i>Senyavin</i>, <i>Apraxin</i>, <i>Ushakoff</i>,
and the cruisers, <i>Oleg</i>, <i>Aurora</i>, <i>Donskoy</i>,
and <i>Monomakh</i>. On either beam, and
parallel with the leading ships, were
the <i>Zemtchug</i> and <i>Izumrud</i>, each
accompanied by two torpedo-boats,
acting as scouts for the port and starboard
columns. In rear of, and between,
the wakes of these columns steamed a
line of transports which we <em>were obliged</em>
to take to Vladivostok<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>—the <i>Anadir</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
<i>Irtish</i>, <i>Korea</i>, <i>Kamchatka</i>—and with
them the repair and steam-tugs, <i>Svir</i>
and <i>Russ</i>, ready to render assistance
in case of need. With the cruiser
squadron were five torpedo-boats, whose
duty it was to co-operate with the
former in protecting the transports
during the battle. Astern of all came
the hospital ships, <i>Orel</i> and <i>Kostroma</i>.</p>

<p>This disposition of the fleet would
make it possible, if the enemy appeared
unexpectedly, for the various squadrons
to take order of battle quickly and
without any complicated manœuvres
(<i>i.e.</i> without attracting attention). The
scout division was to turn from whichever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
side the enemy appeared and to
join the cruisers, which were to convoy
the transports out of action, and protect
them from the enemy’s cruisers. The
1st and 2nd armoured squadrons were
to increase speed, and, having inclined
to port <em>together</em>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> were to take station in
front of the 3rd armoured squadron and
proceed on their former course. The
result would be that the three squadrons
would then be in single column line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
ahead, and the centre of our fleet would
consist of twelve armoured ships. The
<i>Zemtchug</i> and <i>Izumrud</i> were to manœuvre
according to circumstances and, taking
advantage of their speed, together with
the torpedo-boats assigned to them, were
to take station ahead, astern, or abeam
of the armoured ships. They were to
be on the further side of the fleet from
the enemy, out of the range of his
shells; their duty being to prevent the
enemy’s torpedo-boats from getting
round the fleet.</p>

<p>Above was the plan of battle, worked
out beforehand and known to every
officer in the fleet. The various details
as to formations dependent on the
direction in which the enemy appeared,
the instructions for fire control, the
manner in which assistance was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
rendered to injured ships, the transfer
of the Admiral’s flag from one ship
to another, the handing over of the
command, etc., etc., were laid down in
special orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief,
but these details would scarcely
be of interest to readers unacquainted
with naval matters.</p>

<p>The day (25th May) passed quietly.
Towards evening it was reported that
an accident had happened to the
<i>Senyavin’s</i> engines, and all that night
we steamed slowly. In the ward-room
of the <i>Suvoroff</i> the officers grumbled and
swore at the “old tubs,”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> as they nicknamed
Nebogatoff’s ships, but, although
natural, it was hardly fair, for we ourselves
were little better. The prolonged
voyage had been a long mournful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
indictment of our boilers and machinery,
while our martyrs of engineers had
literally had to “get oil out of flints,”
and to effect repairs although with no
material at hand with which to make
them.</p>

<p>That night, the first cold one after
six months in the tropics, we slept
splendidly, but, of course, by watches,
<i>i.e.</i> half the night one half of the
officers and crew were at the guns,
and the other half the remainder.</p>

<p>On 26th May the clouds began to
break and the sun shone fitfully, but
although a fairly fresh south-westerly
breeze had sprung up, a thick mist
still lay upon the water.</p>

<p>Being anxious to avail himself of every
moment of daylight while passing the
Japanese coast, where we would most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
probably be attacked by torpedoes, the
Admiral arranged for the fleet to be
in the centre of its passage through
the straits of Tsu-shima at noon on
the 27th May. According to our
calculations this would give us about
four hours to spare, which we employed
in practising manœuvres for the last
time.</p>

<p>Once again, and for the <em>last</em> time,
we were forcibly reminded of the old
truism that a “fleet” is created by long
years of practice at sea in time of peace
(cruising, not remaining in port), and,
that a collection of ships of various
types hastily collected, which have only
learned to sail together on the way to
the scene of operations, is no fleet, but
a chance concourse of vessels.</p>

<p>Taking up order of battle was moderately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
performed, but it was spoilt by
the 3rd squadron, and who can blame
its admiral or captains? When near
Madagascar, and during our wanderings
off the coast of Annam, our ships to
a certain extent had been able to learn
their work, and to get to know one
another. They had, in fact, been able
to “rehearse.” But as the 3rd squadron,
which joined the fleet barely a fortnight
ago,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> had only arrived in time to finish
the voyage with us and take part in
the battle, there was no time for it
to receive instruction.</p>

<p>Admiral Togo, on the other hand, had
commanded his squadron continuously
for eight years without hauling down
his flag. Five of the vice-admirals and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
seven of the rear-admirals taking part
in the Tsu-shima battle, in command of
squadrons, ships, or as junior flag officers,
were his old comrades and pupils, having
been educated under his command.
As for us, we could only regret our
unpreparedness, and in the coming fight
there was nothing for us to do but to
make the most of what we had.</p>

<p>Rozhdestvensky thought (and facts
later fully justified the opinion) that in
the decisive battle Togo would be at the
head of his twelve best armoured ships.
Against them our Admiral was also to
lead twelve similar ships (which he
handled magnificently), and in the duel
between them it was thought the
centre of gravity of the fight would
certainly lie. The difference between
our main force and that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Japanese was very material. The oldest
of Togo’s twelve ships—the <i>Fuji</i>, was
two years younger than the <i>Sissoy</i>,
which, among our twelve best, came
sixth in seniority! Their speed was
one-and-a-half times as great as ours,
but their chief superiority lay in their
new shells, of which we had no
inkling.</p>

<p>What with manœuvres, etc., the 26th
May passed almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>I do not know the feeling on board
the other ships, but in the <i>Suvoroff</i> we
were cheerful and eager for the fray.
Anxious, of course, we were, but not
so over-anxious as to worry. The
officers went their rounds, and looked
after their men more than usual; explained
details, talked, and found fault
with those immediately under them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
more than was their wont. Some, the
thought suddenly occurring to them,
put their keepsakes and the letters
which they had just written into the
treasure chest for safety.</p>

<p>“He evidently means to leave us!”
said Lieutenant Vladimirsky, the senior
gunnery officer, pointing to a sailor
who was busy rummaging in a bag.</p>

<p>“What! made your preparations for
going already?”</p>

<p>“I?” said he in amazement; and
with a grin—“Yes—I am quite
ready!”</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Lieutenant
Bogdanoff, the senior torpedo officer,
who was a veteran of the former war
and had been wounded at the capture
of the Taku forts—“To-morrow—or
rather to-night—you’ll please go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
office and get your accounts made
up!”</p>

<p>This humour had no effect.</p>

<p>“And haven’t <em>you</em> a presentiment?
<em>You’ve</em> been under fire before,” asked a
young sub-lieutenant, coming up, with
his hand in his pocket, in which was
evidently a letter destined for the
treasure chest.</p>

<p>Bogdanoff got annoyed. “What do
you mean by a presentiment? I’m
not your fortune-teller! I tell you
what! If Japanese guns begin talking
to us to-morrow you will feel something
soon enough,—but you won’t feel anything
before then!”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Some more officers approached.
Times without number we had hotly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
discussed the question,—would we meet
the whole of the Japanese fleet at
Tsu-shima, or only part of it?</p>

<p>Optimists asserted that Togo would
be misled, and would patrol to the
North to look out for us, as the
<i>Terek</i> and <i>Kuban</i> had on the 22nd
gone round the eastern shores of Japan
endeavouring to attract as much
attention there as possible.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Pessimists declared that Togo was as
well able as we were to understand
the conditions, and would know that
a single coaling was not sufficient to
enable us to steam all round Japan;
we should have to coal again. And
where? We were no longer in the
tropics; the weather here was anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
but reliable, which meant we
could not count upon coaling at sea.
Take shelter in some bay?—but there
were telegraph stations, and, of course,
intelligence posts, everywhere. Togo
would learn of it in good time, so
what would he gain by hastening
northward? Even if we succeeded in
coaling at sea and slipped unnoticed
into one of the Straits, we couldn’t
conceal our movements there, thanks
to their narrowness. And then—submarine
and floating mines, sown
along our course, and attacks by
torpedo-boats, which would be easy
even in broad daylight!</p>

<p>It was impossible to pass unnoticed
through these Straits even in a fog
or in bad weather; how then could a
fleet accompanied by transports hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
to escape observation? Even if the
Almighty did bring us through all
this, what was beyond?—the meeting
with the Japanese fleet which from
Tsu-shima could always come out across
our course while our fleet would have
already been harassed in the Straits by
torpedo-boats as well as every conceivable
type of mine.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen—Gentlemen! let me
speak!” exclaimed the first lieutenant
and senior navigating officer, Zotoff,
who was always fond of discussions and
liked making his voice heard. “It is
quite clear that the best course for us is
up the eastern side of the gulf of Korea.
My chief reason for saying so is because
here it is wide and deep, while there is
room for us to manœuvre, and it can be
navigated without danger in any weather.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
In fact, the worse the weather the better
for us. All this has been talked over till
nothing more remains to be said, and
considered till nothing is left to consider;
even disciples of Voltaire themselves
would admit this. Presumably Togo is
no greater fool than we, and knows this.
I assume that he also knows how to use
a pair of compasses and is acquainted
with the four rules of arithmetic! This
being so he can easily calculate that, if
we steam round Japan, deciding in the
face of our knowledge to brave the mines
before meeting him, it would still be
possible for him to intercept us on the
road to Vladivostok, if, at the same
time as we come out of the ocean into
the Straits, he starts from ... Attention,
gentlemen! ... from the northernmost
point of Tsu-shima. There is no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
that arrangements have been made to
organise a defence of the Straits by
mines. The naval ports of Aomori and
Mororan are on either side. If any one
doesn’t know it he ought to be ashamed
of himself. Togo may tell off some of
his smaller mining vessels to go there,
but he, with his main force (I would
even go so far as to say with the whole
of his fleet)—where will he be? No, I
will put another question: Where ought
he to be? Why! nowhere else but off
the northern point of Tsu-shima. He
can gain nothing by loitering about at
sea, so he will be lying in some bay.”</p>

<p>“In Mazampo, for instance?” asked
Sub-Lieutenant Ball, the junior navigating
officer.</p>

<p>“Mazampo—if you like—but let me
finish. It is childish to hope that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Japanese main fleet will be out of the
way. I think we have reached the
culminating point of our adventures.
To-morrow the decision must be made:
either vertically”—and, putting his hand
above his head, he energetically waved
it downwards in front of him—“or”—quietly
moving his arm out to the right,
and dropping it slowly downwards in a
circular direction—“a longer route, but
to the west all the same.”</p>

<p>“How? Why? Why to the west?”
broke in the bystanders.</p>

<p>“Because though the end may not
come at once,” shouted Zotoff, “the
result will be the same! It’s absurd to
think of steaming victoriously into
Vladivostok, or of getting command of
the sea! The only possible chance is
a dash through! and having dashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
through, after two, three, or at the most
four sallies, we shall have burnt all our
supplies of coal, and have shed our
blossoms before we have bloomed! We
shall have to prepare for a siege, take
our guns on shore, teach the crew to
use bayonets——”</p>

<p>“A bas! A bas! Conspuez le
prophête!” interrupted some. “Hear!
Hear! strongly<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> said!” shouted others.
“What about Austria’s Parliament!”</p>

<p>“Let him finish,” growled Bogdanoff
in his bass voice.</p>

<p>“Having postponed a discussion of
questions of the distant future—a discussion
which makes those who take part
in it so excited,” continued Zotoff, availing
himself of a quiet moment, “I will
venture to say a few words concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
what is immediately at hand. I foresee
three possibilities. Firstly:—If we
have already been discovered, or are
discovered in the course of the day,
we shall certainly be subjected at night
to a series of torpedo attacks, and in
the morning shall have to fight the
Japanese fleet, which will be unpleasant.
Secondly:—If we are not discovered till
to-morrow we shall be able to commence
the fight at full strength, without
casualties, which will be better. Lastly,
and thirdly:—If the mist thickens and
dirty weather comes on, thanks to the
width of the Straits, we may either slip
through, or be discovered too late, when
there will be only the open sea between
us and Vladivostok.—This would be
excellent. On these three chances those
who wish may start the totalisator!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
For myself, preparing for the worst,
and foreseeing a broken night, I suggest
that we all take advantage of every
spare hour to sleep.”</p>

<p>His words had the desired effect.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fate had apparently been kind to us,
as up to the present we had not been
discovered. The sending of telegrams
in the fleet was forbidden, so we were
able to intercept Japanese messages, and
our torpedo officers made every effort
to fix the direction from which they
emanated. On the morning of 26th
May and later on the same day, a conversation
between two installations had
begun, or perhaps more correctly speaking
it was the reports of one ahead
of and nearer to us to which the other,
more distant and on the port side, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
replying. The messages were not in
cypher, and although our telegraphists
were unaccustomed to the strange
alphabet, and notwithstanding the gaps
in the sentences by the time we received
them, it was still possible to pick out
separate words, and even sentences.
“Last night” ... “nothing” ...
“eleven lights ... but not in line” ...
“bright light ... the same star
...” etc.</p>

<p>In all probability this was a powerful
coast station on the Goto Islands,
reporting to some one a long way off
what had been seen in the Straits.</p>

<p>Towards evening we took in a conversation
between other installations,
which at night had increased to seven.
The messages were in cypher, but by
their brevity and uniformity and by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
fact that they commenced and ceased
at fixed times, we were able to calculate
with tolerable accuracy that these were
not reports, but merely messages exchanged
between the scouts. It was
clear that we had not been discovered.</p>

<p>At sunset the fleet closed up, and in
expectation of torpedo attacks half the
officers and crew were detailed for duty
at the guns, the remainder sleeping by
their posts, without undressing, ready to
jump up on the first sound of the alarm.</p>

<p>The night came on dark. The mist
seemed to grow denser, and through it
but few stars could be seen. On the
dark deck there prevailed a strained
stillness, broken at times only by the
sighs of the sleepers, the steps of an
officer, or by an order given in an
undertone. Near the guns the motionless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
figures of their crews seemed like
dead, but all were wide awake, gazing
keenly into the darkness. Was not
that the dark shadow of a torpedo-boat?
They listened attentively. Surely the
throb of her engines and the noise of
steam must betray an invisible foe?</p>

<p>Stepping carefully, so as not to disturb
the sleepers, I went round the
bridges and decks, and then proceeded
to the engine-room. For a moment
the bright light blinded me. Here,
life and movement was visible on all
sides. Men were nimbly running up
and down the ladders; there was a
tinkling of bells and buzzing of voices.
Orders were being transmitted loudly,
but, on looking more intently, the
tension and anxiety—that same peculiar
frame of mind so noticeable on deck—could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
also be observed. And then it
suddenly occurred to me that all this—the
tall, somewhat bent figure of the
Admiral on the side of the bridge, the
wrinkled face of the man at the wheel
stooping over the compass, the guns’
crews chilled to the bone at their posts,
these men talking loudly and running
about, the giant connecting-rods whose
steel glittered dimly in the dark, and
the mighty hissing of steam in the
cylinders—was one and the same thing.</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered the old sea
legend of the ship’s spirit dwelling in
every rivet, nail, and screw, which at
the fated moment takes possession of
the whole ship with her crew, and turns
both crew and surroundings into one
indivisible supernatural being. Of a
sudden it seemed that this spirit was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
looking right into my heart, which
beat with unusual rapidity, and for a
moment it seemed as if I had become
this being to whom the name <i>Suvoroff</i>—so
sacred to all of us—was no more
than a mere rivet!</p>

<p>It was a flash of madness, which
quickly passed, leaving behind it only
a sensation akin to daring and grim
determination.</p>

<p>Alongside of me, the chief engineer,
Captain Bernander, my old shipmate and
friend, was angrily explaining something
to his assistant. I did not hear what
he said, nor could I understand why
he was so excited when everything
had been finally settled. Whether for
better or for worse it was impossible to
alter things now.</p>

<p>“All in good time, my dear fellow,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
said I, taking his arm. “Let us go and
drink some tea—my throat is parched.”</p>

<p>Turning his kind grey eyes on me in
astonishment, and without replying, he
allowed me to lead him away.</p>

<p>We went up to the ward-room, which
at this hour was usually crowded and
noisy. It was empty. Two or three
officers, after being relieved, as well as
some from the nearest light gun batteries,
were sound asleep on the sofas, awaiting
the alarm, or for their turn to go
on watch. The messman, however, who
was always ready for any emergency,
brought us tea. Again on all sides this
dreadful, painful stillness.</p>

<p>“The chief thing is, not to be in too
great a hurry.—One straight shot is
better than two bad ones.—Remember
that we have not a single spare shell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and, till we reach Vladivostok, none are
to be got,” came in a somewhat inaudible
voice from behind the closed door of the
stern cabin. Evidently a sub-lieutenant,
Fomin by name, was holding forth.</p>

<p>“Preaching!” angrily said Bernander,
helping himself to some hot tea.</p>

<p>I saw that he was very annoyed about
something and wished to unburden
himself.</p>

<p>“Well! tell me all about it! What
is the matter?”</p>

<p>“It is all this cursed German coal,”
he said, and lowering his voice and looking
rounds—“You know, of course, that
we had a fire in the bunkers?”</p>

<p>“Yes! I know; but surely, thank
goodness, they put it out? Do you
mean there’s another?”</p>

<p>“No! Not quite! Listen! There’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
a vast difference between rapid-burning
and slow-burning coal. Much more is
consumed. Compared to good coal, 20
to 30 per cent.——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” I interrupted. “Why,
what’s up with you? Are you afraid
you’ll run out? Up till now, surely,
you have been burning our surplus!
You ought to have in hand the full
normal quantity.”</p>

<p>“Full or not, we shall have less than
1000 tons by morning.”</p>

<p>“But it’s 600 miles to Vladivostok!
Where do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten the <i>Cesarevitch</i>?
On 10th August, when her funnels were
shot away, she burnt 480 tons in the
twenty-four hours! Well—we are
burning more!”</p>

<p>“Pooh! your nerves are unstrung,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
exclaimed. “All your bunkers haven’t
caught fire!”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand!” angrily
exclaimed Bernander, and, quickly
finishing his tea, he seized his cap
and went out.</p>

<p>I remained in the ward-room, settled
myself down in an easy-chair, and,
making myself comfortable, dozed. I
heard indistinctly the watch being
relieved at midnight. Some of the
officers coming off duty came in to
get some tea, and in low voices abused
the infernal rawness of the night air.
Others stretched themselves on sofas,
sighing with relief at being so comfortable,
and said: “We’ll sleep till four!
it’s a holiday at home!”</p>

<p>I also went to sleep.</p>

<p>About 3 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> I awoke, and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
went round the ship and up on deck.
The scene was just the same as in the
evening, but it was lighter. In the last
quarter the moon had risen well up, and
against the mist, dimly whitened by its
silver rays, the ship’s funnels, masts,
and rigging were sharply outlined. The
breeze, freshening, blew cold, making
me pull the cape of my coat more over
my head.</p>

<p>Going on to the fore-bridge, I found
the Admiral sleeping in a chair. The
Commander, wearing soft slippers, was
pacing rapidly but quietly up and down
the bridge.</p>

<p>“What are you doing wandering
about?” he asked me.</p>

<p>“O, just having a look round. Gone
to sleep?” and I nodded towards the
Admiral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
“Only just. I persuaded him to.
Why shouldn’t he? We can take it
that the night has passed all right. Up
to the present we haven’t been discovered.
They are still calling each other up,
and now, even though they do find us,
it’s late. It will be daybreak in a couple
of hours. Even if their torpedo-boats
are near us, they won’t be able to
collect. Besides, how can they find us
in weather like this? Look! you can’t
even see the rear of the fleet! It’s
200,000 to 1 against any one running
into us accidentally! But I don’t like
the breeze. It’s freshening. Let’s hope
it won’t break up the mist. If it does
to-morrow will mean the end of the
<i>Suvoroff</i>. But it’s suddenly coming on
thicker,” he said eagerly. “Why, we
have been going for twenty-four hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
without being seen. If it is the same
to-morrow, we’ll give them the slip!
They are on the move, and keep calling
each other up, and they haven’t yet
come on us! They’ll have to wait for
our second coming, out of Vladivostok!
That’ll be a different tale. My! what
a stew they must be in! What fun!”
and putting his handkerchief in his
mouth so as not to disturb the Admiral,
he laughed so heartily, and seemed so
free from care, that I envied him.</p>

<p>It should be stated that V. V.
Ignatzius, in the first place, was one of
those who was firmly convinced that
the success of our voyage—this desperate
adventure—depended solely on the
extent of co-operation of Saint Nicolas
“The Casual” and other heavenly
powers, and, in the second place, bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
in mind the Japanese custom of
concentrating their fire on the flag-ship,
he believed that both he and his ship
were doomed to destruction in the first
decisive engagement. But, in spite of
this, he never for a moment lost his
invariably buoyant and cheery manner.
He joked, chaffed, and eagerly threw
himself into all the little details of daily
life on board, while now (I really believe)
he was, inwardly, much amused, picturing
to himself the anger and disappointment
of the Japanese in the event of
our actually slipping past them.</p>

<p>But the Japanese “got the 200,000th
chance,” and more.</p>

<p>At dawn on 27th May, about 5 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>,
the auxiliary cruiser <i>Sinano Maru</i>
almost ran into our hospital ships, and
it was due to this that the whole fleet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
was discovered. We were unable to
see what had happened, but by the
changed character of the messages it
became at once apparent that our
presence was known. The scouts no
longer merely called each other up,
and we now took in reports, which
were being transmitted further and
further to the north.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Messages came in from both sides,
so the Admiral recalled the <i>Almaz</i>,
<i>Svietlana</i> and <i>Ural</i>, in order to protect
our helpless rear (transports) from
sudden attack.</p>

<p>About 6 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> the <i>Ural</i> came up at
full speed, reporting by semaphore that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
astern of the fleet four ships, which
it was impossible to recognise in the
mist, were crossing from starboard to
port.</p>

<p>At 6.45 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> a vessel appeared on the
starboard beam, which, as her course
brought her nearer to us, was soon
recognised as the <i>Idzumi</i>. About 8 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>,
despite the mist, we were able to take
her distance as 10,000 yards. The alarm
sounding, the after turret threateningly
raised her 12-inch guns, but the <i>Idzumi</i>,
guessing her danger, commenced rapidly
to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>We might, of course, have detached
a good cruiser to drive her off, but alas!
there were in the fleet only two ships
answering to this description—the <i>Oleg</i>
and the <i>Aurora</i>, also possibly the scout
<i>Svietlana</i>; of the remainder, the <i>Donskoy</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and <i>Monomakh</i> were respectable veterans,
slow, though passably armed. The
<i>Ural</i> and <i>Almaz</i> were swift, but had
only toy guns. Besides, each moment
we were expecting to meet our formidable
opponent, when every gun and
shell would be of value. If the issue
of the battle were to be decided by
a duel between our three armoured
squadrons and the twelve best Japanese
ships, the whole of the rest of the
enemy’s fleet would fall to the lot
of our cruiser squadron. A struggle
for which we must indeed reserve
our strength! Rozhdestvensky decided
accordingly to ignore the <i>Idzumi’s</i>
daring sally, and sent no one in pursuit
of her.</p>

<p>Shortly after 8 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, on the port bow,
the <i>Chin-Yen</i>, <i>Matsushima</i>, <i>Itsukushima</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
and <i>Hashidate</i> appeared out of the mist,
steaming on an almost parallel course.
Ahead of them was a small, light cruiser,
apparently the <i>Akitsushu</i>, which hurriedly
drew off to the north as soon as we
were able to see her well (and equally
she us), and the whole squadron began
slowly to increase their distance and
gradually to disappear from sight.</p>

<p>At about 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> the light cruisers
<i>Chitose</i>, <i>Kasagi</i>, <i>Niitaka</i>, and <i>Otawa</i>, also
appeared on the port beam, and it
became evident to all of us that the
decisive moment could not now be long
postponed.</p>

<p>At a signal from the flag-ship, the 1st
and 2nd armoured squadrons steamed
ahead, and, turning “together,” 2
points<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> to port, began to take position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
ahead of the 3rd squadron. The transports
were ordered to keep more to
starboard and astern of the fleet, while
the cruisers were to cover them on the
port side. To starboard of the transports
was the <i>Monomakh</i>, detailed to
protect them from the <i>Idzumi</i> and
suchlike vessels.</p>

<p>At 11.20 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, when the distance of the
Japanese light cruisers was 10,000 yards,
the <i>Orel</i> fired an accidental shot (which
she immediately reported by semaphore).
Unable with smokeless powder to tell by
which of the leading ships it had been
fired, the fleet took it as a signal from
the <i>Suvoroff</i>, and opened fire. Of the
whole fleet the fire of the 3rd squadron
was the heaviest.</p>

<p>The Japanese cruisers turned to port
and, firing also, rapidly drew off. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
flag-ship then signalled, “<em>Ammunition not
to be wasted</em>,” and when the firing ceased,
“Ships’ companies to have dinner at once.”</p>

<p>At midday, finding ourselves on a line
with the southernmost point of Tsu-shima,
we shaped course N.23°E. for
Vladivostok.</p>

<p>The officers also had breakfast now, in
turn, and as quickly as possible. To-day
there was to have been as usual a big
breakfast in the ward-room, with the
Admiral and his Captain and staff as
guests: but on this occasion it naturally
could not take place as the Admiral
and Captain were unable to leave the
bridge, and the staff only dashed down
to the Admiral’s table to eat a few
mouthfuls.</p>

<p>Having gone down to my cabin to
fill my cigarette-case before the fight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
I happened to look in at the ward-room
at the psychological minute. Although
the dishes were being handed anyhow
and whatever came nearest was taken,
champagne sparkled in the glasses, and
every one was standing up, silently listening
to the toast proposed by the senior
officer, A. P. Makedonsky.</p>

<p>“On this, the great anniversary of the
sacred Coronation of their Highnesses,
may God help us to serve with honour
our beloved Country! To the health
of the Emperor! the Empress!—To
Russia!”</p>

<p>The ward-room resounded with cheers,
and their last echoes had scarcely died
away ere the alarm sounded on deck.
Every one rushed to their stations, to
find that some Japanese light cruisers
had again appeared on our port bow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
but this time they were accompanied by
torpedo-boats, which evidently intended
to cross our bows. Suspecting that their
plan was to lay floating mines (as they
had done on 10th August), the Admiral
ordered the 1st squadron to turn to
starboard, so as to drive off the enemy
by threatening him with the fire of our
five best battleships.</p>

<p>With this intention the ships of the
1st squadron turned “in succession” 8
points (90°) to starboard, and should
afterwards have turned “together” 8
points to port. The first half of the
manœuvre was most successfully performed,
but the signal for the second
was evidently misunderstood, as the
<i>Alexander</i> followed the <i>Suvoroff</i>, while
the <i>Borodino</i> and <i>Orel</i>, which had
already commenced to turn correctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
“together,” imagining then that they
were mistaken, turned back and followed
the <i>Alexander</i>. Consequently the 1st
squadron found itself in single column
line ahead, parallel to the 2nd and 3rd
squadrons, but somewhat ahead of
them.</p>

<p>This unsuccessful manœuvre, however,
had a most important result. The
enemy’s cruisers and torpedo-boats,
afraid of being caught between the fire
of both columns, abandoned their intention
of crossing our course, and
hurriedly drew off to port. These
cruisers probably also reported to Togo
that we were steaming in two columns,
and he (being then out of sight and far
ahead of us on the starboard bow)
decided to cross over to our port side,
so as to throw himself with all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
strength upon our port and weakest
column.</p>

<p>As soon as the Japanese drew off, the
1st squadron at once increased speed,
inclining to port so as again to take
station ahead of the 2nd squadron.</p>

<p>At 1.20 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, when the 1st had got
ahead of the 2nd and 3rd squadrons and
was steering on its former course, the
flag-ship signalled, “The 2nd squadron,
maintaining its formation, will take
station astern of the 1st.”</p>

<p>And now, far ahead of us in the
distance, could be dimly seen approaching
through the mist the Japanese main
force. Their ships were crossing our
bows from starboard to port, following
on an almost south-west course. The
<i>Mikasa</i>, as soon as she crossed our bows,
at once altered course to the southward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
followed by the <i>Shikishima</i>, <i>Fuji</i>, Asahi,
<i>Kasuga</i>, and <i>Nisshin</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though the flag-ship was
already being worked from the conning
tower, Rozhdestvensky was still standing
with his staff on the upper fore-bridge.</p>

<p>I frankly confess that I did not agree
with his opinion as to Togo leading all
his twelve armoured ships in column; on
10th August he ordered six of them
to work independently, instead of joining
his squadron. I was inclined to think
that Kamimura would operate independently
and, when my six old Port
Arthur acquaintances hove in sight, I
said triumphantly:</p>

<p>“There they are, sir—<em>all six</em>—just as
on 10th August.”</p>

<p>But Rozhdestvensky, without turning,
shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
“No, there are more—they are all
there,” and he went down into the
conning tower.</p>

<p>“To your stations, gentlemen,” said
the Flag Captain quickly, as he followed
the Admiral.</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, following
after the first six ships, and slowly
appearing out of the mist, came the
<i>Idzumo</i>, <i>Yakumo</i>, <i>Asama</i>, <i>Adzuma</i>,
<i>Tokiwa</i>, and <i>Iwate</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>“Now the fun will begin,” thought I
to myself, going up to the after-bridge,
which seemed to be the most convenient
place for carrying out my
duty of seeing and noting down everything,
as from there I could see both
the enemy and our own fleet. Lieutenant
Reydkin, commanding the after
starboard 6-inch turret, was also there,
having dashed up to see what was
going on, as the fight was apparently
to commence to port, and his turret
would not be in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
We stood side by side, exchanging
now and again abrupt remarks, not
understanding why the Japanese intended
crossing to our port side, when
our weak spot—the transports and
cruisers covering them—was astern, and
to starboard of us. Perhaps, having
commenced the fight while steering on
the opposite course, and having taken
advantage of their superior speed, they
calculated on rounding us from the
stern, in order to fall at the same time
on our transports and weak rear! If
so, a raking fire would present no
difficulties.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Look! What <em>are</em> they up
to?” said Reydkin, and his voice betrayed
both delight and amazement.</p>

<p>I looked and looked, and, not believing
my eyes, could not put down my glasses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
The Japanese ships had suddenly commenced
to turn “in succession” to port,
reversing their course!</p>

<p>If the reader recollects what has been
said previously on the subject of turns,
he will easily understand that this
manœuvre made it necessary for all the
enemy’s ships to pass in succession over
the point on which the leading ship
had turned; this point was, so to speak,
stationary on the water, making it easy
for us to range and aim. Besides—even
with a speed of 15 knots,
the manœuvre must take about fifteen
minutes to complete, and all this time
the vessels, which had already turned,
would mask the fire of those which
were still coming up.</p>

<p>“<em>How</em> rash!” said Reydkin, who
could not keep quiet. “Why, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
minute we’ll be able to roll up the
leading ships!”</p>

<p>“Please God, we may!” thought I.</p>

<p>It was plain to me that Togo, seeing
something which he had not expected,
had suddenly changed his mind. The
manœuvre was undoubtedly risky, but, on
the other hand, if he found it necessary
to steer on the opposite course, there
was no other way of doing it. He
might have ordered the fleet to turn
“together,” but this would have made
the cruiser <i>Iwate</i> the leading ship in
action, which he evidently did not wish.
Togo accordingly decided to turn “in
succession,” in order that he should lead
the fleet in person, and not leave success
at the commencement of the action to
depend upon the presence of mind and
enterprise of the junior flag-officer. (The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
<i>Iwate</i> flew Rear-Admiral Simamura’s
flag.)</p>

<p>My heart beat furiously, as it had
never done before during the six months
at Port Arthur. If we succeeded!
God grant it! Even though we didn’t
sink one of them, if we could only put
one out of action! The first success—was
it possible?</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rozhdestvensky hastened
to avail himself of this favourable
opportunity.</p>

<p>At <em>1.49 p.m.</em>, when the manœuvre
had been performed by the <i>Mikasa</i> and
<i>Shikishima</i> (two only out of the twelve),
the <i>Suvoroff</i> fired the first shot at a
range of 6,400 yards, and the guns of the
whole fleet thundered forth. I watched
closely through my glasses. The shots
which went over and those which fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
short were all close, but the most interesting,
<i>i.e.</i> the hits, as in the fight of 10th
August, could not be seen. Our shells
on bursting emitted scarcely any smoke,
and the fuses were adjusted to burst
inside after penetrating the target. A
hit could only be detected when something
fell—and nothing fell! In a
couple of minutes, when the <i>Fuji</i> and
<i>Asahi</i> had turned also and were following
the first ships, the enemy began to
reply.</p>

<p>The first shells flew over us. At
this range some of the long ones
turned a complete somersault, and could
clearly be seen with the naked eye
curving like so many sticks thrown in
the air. They flew over us, making a
sort of wail, different to the ordinary
roar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
“Are those the portmanteaus?”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> I asked
Reydkin, smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes. Those are they.”</p>

<p>But what struck me most was that
these “portmanteaus,” curving awkwardly
head over heels through the air and
falling anyhow on the water, exploded
the moment they touched its surface.
This had never happened before.</p>

<p>After them came others short of us—nearer
and nearer. Splinters whistled
through the air, jingled against the
side and superstructure. Then, quite
close and abreast the foremost funnel,
rose a gigantic pillar of smoke, water
and flame. I saw stretchers being carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
along the fore-bridge, and I leaned over
the rail.</p>

<p>“Prince Tsereteli!”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> shouted Reydkin
from below, in reply to my silent
question, as he went towards his turret.</p>

<p>The next shell struck the side by the
centre 6-inch turret, and there was a
tremendous noise behind and below me
on the port quarter. Smoke and tongues
of fire leapt out of the officers’ gangway;
a shell having fallen into the captain’s
cabin, and having penetrated the deck,
had burst in the officers’ quarters, setting
them on fire.</p>

<p>And here I was able to observe, and
not for the first time, the stupor which
seems to come over men, who have never
been in action before, when the first
shells begin to fall. A stupor which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
turns easily and instantaneously, at the
most insignificant external shock, into
either uncontrollable panic which cannot
be allayed, or into unusually high
spirits, depending on the man’s character.</p>

<p>The men at the fire mains and
hoses stood as if mesmerised, gazing at
the smoke and flames, not understanding,
apparently, what was happening. I went
down to them from the bridge, and with
the most commonplace words, such as
“Wake up! Turn the water on!”—got
them to pull themselves together
and bravely to fight the fire.</p>

<p>I was taking out my watch and pocket-book
to make a note of the first fire,
when something suddenly struck me in
the waist, and something large and soft,
though heavy, hit me in the back, lifting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
me up and hurling me on to the deck.
When I again got up, my note-book and
watch were in my hands as before. My
watch was going; but the second hand
was slightly bent, and the glass had disappeared.
Stupefied by the blow, and
not myself, I began carefully to hunt
for it on the deck, and found it unbroken.
Picking it up, I fitted it
in to my watch—and, only then realising
that I had been occupied with
something of no importance, I looked
round.</p>

<p>I had probably been unconscious for
some time, as the fire had been extinguished,
and, save for two or three
dead bodies on which water was pouring
from the torn hoses, no one was to be
seen. Whatever had struck me had come
from the direction of the deck house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
aft, which was hidden from me by a
mantlet of hammocks. I looked in the
direction where the flag-officers, with a
party of poop signalmen, should have
been. The shell had passed through the
deck house, bursting inside. Of the ten
or twelve signalmen, some seemed to
be standing by the starboard 6-inch
turret, others seemed to be lying in a
huddled group. Inside was a pile of
something, and on the top lay an officer’s
telescope.</p>

<p>“Is this all that is left?” I wondered,
but I was wrong, as by some miracle
Novosiltseff and Kozakevitch were only
wounded and, helped by Maximoff, had
gone to the dressing station, while I
was lying on the deck occupied with
mending my watch.</p>

<p>“Hullo! a scene that you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
accustomed to? Like the 10th
August?” said the irrepressible Reydkin,
peeping out of his turret.</p>

<p>“Just the same!” I replied in a
confident tone. But it was hardly so:
indeed, it would have been more correct
to say—“Not in the least like.”</p>

<p>On 10th August, in a fight lasting
some hours, the <i>Cesarevitch</i> was struck
by only nineteen large shells, and I, in
all seriousness, had intended in the
present engagement to note the times
and the places where we were hit, as
well as the damage done. But how
could I make detailed notes when it
seemed impossible even to count the
number of projectiles striking us? I
had not only never witnessed such a
fire before, but I had never imagined
anything like it. Shells seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
pouring upon us incessantly, one after
another.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>After six months with the Port Arthur
squadron I had grown indifferent to most
things. Shimose and melinite were to a
certain extent old acquaintances, but
this was something new. It seemed
as if these were mines, not shells,
which were striking the ship’s side and
falling on the deck. They burst as
soon as they touched anything—the
moment they encountered the least
impediment in their flight. Handrails,
funnel guys, topping lifts of the boats’
derricks, were quite sufficient to cause
a thoroughly efficient burst. The steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
plates and superstructure on the upper
deck were torn to pieces, and the
splinters caused many casualties. Iron
ladders were crumpled up into rings,
and guns were literally hurled from
their mountings.</p>

<p>Such havoc would never be caused
by the simple impact of a shell, still
less by that of its splinters. It could
only be caused by the force of the
explosion. The Japanese had apparently
succeeded in realising what the
Americans had endeavoured to attain in
inventing their “Vesuvium.”</p>

<p>In addition to this, there was the
unusual high temperature and liquid
flame of the explosion, which seemed
to spread over everything. I actually
watched a steel plate catch fire from
a burst. Of course, the steel did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
burn, but the paint on it did. Such
almost non-combustible materials as
hammocks, and rows of boxes, drenched
with water, flared up in a moment.
At times it was impossible to see
anything with glasses, owing to everything
being so distorted with the
quivering, heated air. No! It was
different to the 10th August!<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
I hurriedly went to the Admiral in
the conning tower. Why? At the
time I did not attempt to think, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
now feel sure that I merely wished to
see him, and by seeing him to confirm
my impressions. Was it all imagination?
Was it all a nightmare? Had
I become jumpy?</p>

<p>Running along the fore-bridge I almost
fell, slipping in a pool of blood (the chief
signalman—Kandaooroff—had just been
killed there). I went into the conning
tower, and found the Admiral and
Captain both bending down, looking out
through the chink between the armour
and the roof.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the Captain, energetically
gesticulating as was his wont, “we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
shorten the distance. They’re all being
killed—they are on fire!”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit. Aren’t we all being
killed also?” replied the Admiral.</p>

<p>Close to the wheel, and on either
side of it, lay two bodies in officers’
tunics—face downwards.</p>

<p>“The officer at the wheel, and Berseneff!”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
was shouted in my ear by a sub-lieutenant—Shishkin—whose
arm I had
touched, pointing to the bodies. “Berseneff
first—in the head—quite dead.”</p>

<p>The range-finder was worked.
Vladimirsky shouted his orders in a
clear voice, and the electricians quickly
turned the handles of the indicator,
transmitting the range to the turrets
and light gun batteries.</p>

<p>“We’re all right,” thought I to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
myself, going out of the conning tower,
but the next moment the thought
flashed across me: “They can’t see what
is going on on board.” Leaving the
tower, I looked out intently on all sides
from the fore-bridge. Were not my
recent thoughts, which I had not dared
to put into words, realised?</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>The enemy had finished turning. His
twelve ships were in perfect order at
close intervals, steaming parallel to us,
but gradually forging ahead. No disorder
was noticeable. It seemed to me
that with my Zeiss glasses (the distance
was a little more than 4,000 yards), I
could even distinguish the mantlets of
hammocks on the bridges, and groups
of men. But with us? I looked round.
What havoc!—Burning bridges, smouldering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> on the decks,—piles of dead
bodies. Signalling and judging distance
stations, gun-directing positions, all were
destroyed. And astern of us the <i>Alexander</i>
and <i>Borodino</i> were also enveloped
in smoke. No! it was very different to
the 10th August.</p>

<p>The enemy, steaming ahead, commenced
quickly to incline to starboard, endeavouring
to cross our T. We also bore to
starboard, and again we had him almost
on our beam.</p>

<p><em>It was now 2.5 p.m.</em></p>

<p>A man came up to report what had
taken place in the after 12-inch turret.
I went to look. Part of the shield over
the port gun had been torn off and bent
upwards, but the turret was still turning
and keeping up a hot fire.</p>

<p>The officer commanding the fire parties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
had had both his legs blown off and was
carried below. Men fell faster and faster.
Reinforcements were required everywhere
to replace casualties, even at the turrets
into which splinters could only penetrate
through the narrow gun ports. The
dead were, of course, left to lie where
they had fallen, but yet there were not
enough men to look after the wounded.</p>

<p>There are no spare men on board a
warship, and a reserve does not exist.
Each man is detailed for some particular
duty, and told off to his post in action.
The only source which we could tap was
the crews of the 47 millimetre, and
machine, guns, who from the commencement
of the fight had been
ordered to remain below the armoured
deck so as not to be unnecessarily
exposed. Having nothing to do now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
as all their guns, which were in exposed
positions on the bridges, had been
utterly destroyed, we made use of
them, but they were a mere drop in the
ocean. As for the fires, even if we had
had the men, we were without the means
with which to fight them. Over and over
again the hoses in use were changed for
new ones, but these also were soon
torn to ribbons, and the supply became
exhausted. Without hoses how could
we pump water on to the bridges and
spar-deck where the flames raged? On
the spar-deck, in particular, where eleven
wooden boats were piled up, the fire
was taking a firm hold. Up till now,
this “store of wood” had only caught
fire in places, as the water which had
been poured into the boats prior to the
commencement of the action was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in them, though it was fast trickling
out of the numerous cracks momentarily
being made by the splinters.</p>

<p>We, of course, did everything possible:
tried to plug the holes, and brought up
water in buckets.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> I am not certain if
the scuppers had been closed on purpose,
or had merely become blocked, but
practically none of the water we used
for the fire ran overboard, and it lay,
instead, on the upper deck. This was
fortunate, as, in the first place, the deck
itself did not catch fire, and, in the second,
we threw into it the smouldering <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>
falling from above—merely separating the
burning pieces and turning them over.</p>

<p>Seeing Flag Sub-Lieutenant Demchinsky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
standing by the ladder of the fore-bridge,
with a party of forecastle signalmen near
the starboard forward 6-inch turret, I
went up to him. Golovnin, another sub-lieutenant,
who was in charge of the turret,
gave us some cold tea to drink, which
he had stored in bottles. It seems a
trifle, but it cheered us up.</p>

<p>Demchinsky told me that the first
shell striking the ship had fallen right into
the temporary dressing station, rigged up
by the doctor in what seemed the most
sheltered spot on the upper battery
(between the centre 6-inch turrets by
the ship’s ikon). He said that it had
caused a number of casualties; that the
doctor somehow escaped, but the ship’s
chaplain had been dangerously wounded.
I went there to have a look at the place.</p>

<p>The ship’s ikon or, more properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
speaking, ikons as there were several
of them, all farewell gifts to the ship,
were untouched. The glass of the big
ikon case had not even been broken,
and in front of it, on hanging candlesticks,
candles were peacefully burning. There
wasn’t a soul to be seen. Between the
wrecked tables, stools, broken bottles,
and different hospital appliances were
some dead bodies, and a mass of something,
which, with difficulty, I guessed
to be the remains of what had once
been men.</p>

<p>I had not had time properly to take
in this scene of destruction when Demchinsky
came down the ladder, supporting
Flag Lieutenant Sverbeyeff, who
could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>He was gasping for breath, and asked
for water. Ladling some out of a bucket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
into a mess kettle, I gave him some,
and, as he was unable to use his arms,
we had to help him. He drank greedily,
jerking out a few words—“It’s a trifle—tell
the Flag Captain—I’ll come immediately—I
am suffocated with these
cursed gases—I’ll get my breath in a
minute.” He inhaled the air with a great
effort through his blue lips, and something
seemed to rattle in his throat and
chest, though not, of course, the poisonous
gases. On the right side of his back his
coat was torn in a great rent, and his
wound was bleeding badly. Demchinsky
told off a couple of men to take him
down to the hospital, and we again went
on deck.</p>

<p>I crossed over to the port side, between
the forward 12-inch and 6-inch turrets,
to have a look at the enemy’s fleet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
It was all there, just the same—no fires—no
heeling over—no fallen bridges,
as if it had been at drill instead of
fighting, and as if our guns, which had
been thundering incessantly for the last
half-hour, had been firing—not shells,
but the devil alone knows what!<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Feeling almost in despair, I put down
my glasses and went aft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
“The last of the halyards are burned,”
said Demchinsky to me. “I think I
shall take my men somewhere under
cover.” Of course, I fully agreed. What
was the use of the signalmen remaining
under fire when nothing was left for
them to signal with!</p>

<p><em>It was now 2.20 p.m.</em></p>

<p>Making my way aft through the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>, I met Reydkin hurrying to the
forecastle. “We can’t fire from the
port quarter,” he said excitedly; “everything
is on fire there, and the men are
suffocated with heat and smoke.”</p>

<p>“Well! come on, let’s get some one
to put the fire out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, but you report to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Admiral. Perhaps he will give us some
orders.”</p>

<p>“What orders can he give?”</p>

<p>“He may alter the course. I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>“What! leave the line? Is it likely?”</p>

<p>“Well! anyway, you tell him.”</p>

<p>In order to quiet him, I promised to
report at once, and we separated, going
our ways. As I anticipated, the Admiral
only shrugged his shoulders on hearing
my report and said, “They <em>must</em> put
the fire out. No help can be sent from
here.”</p>

<p>Instead of two dead bodies, five or six
were now lying in the conning tower.
The man at the wheel having been incapacitated,
Vladimirsky had taken his
place. His face was covered with blood,
but his moustache was smartly twisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
upwards, and he wore the same self-confident
look as he had in the ward-room
when discussing “the future of
gunnery.”</p>

<p>Leaving the tower, I intended going
to Reydkin to tell him the Admiral’s
reply and to assist in extinguishing the
fire, but instead I remained on the
bridge looking at the Japanese fleet.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>After steering on their new course for
a quarter of an hour, the enemy had
again forged a considerable distance
ahead, and now the <i>Mikasa</i>, at the
head of the column, gradually inclined
to starboard to cross our T. I waited
for us to incline to starboard also, but
the Admiral held on to the old course
for some time longer. I guessed that
by doing this he hoped to lessen the
distance as much as possible, which
would naturally have assisted us, since,
with our wrecked range-finders and gun-directing
positions, our guns were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
serviceable at close quarters. However,
to allow the enemy to cross our T and
to subject ourselves to a raking fire
was not to be thought of. Counting
the moments anxiously I watched and
waited. The <i>Mikasa</i> came closer and
closer to our course. Our 6-inch starboard
turret was already preparing to fire,
when—we sharply inclined to starboard.
Breathing freely again, I looked around.</p>

<p>Demchinsky had not yet gone below
with his men but was hard at work,
apparently moving the cartridge boxes
of the 47-millimetre guns off the deck
into the turret, so that there should be
less risk of their exploding in the fire
and causing greater damage. I went to
ask him what he was doing, but before
I was able to say anything the Captain
appeared at the top of the ladder just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
behind me. His head was covered with
blood and, staggering convulsively, he
clutched at the hand-rail. At that
moment a shell burst quite close to us
and, losing his balance from the sudden
explosion, he fell, head foremost, down
the ladder. Luckily we saw it and
were able to catch him.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing—only a trifle,” he said
in his ordinary quick way of speaking.
He tried to force a smile and, jumping
up, endeavoured to go on. But as
to go on to the hospital meant another
three ladders, we put him, in spite of
his protests, on a stretcher.</p>

<p>A man reported that the after turret
had been blown up<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and almost simultaneously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
there resounded above us a
rumbling noise accompanied by the
sharp clank of falling iron. Something
large and heavy fell with a crash; the
ship’s boats on the spar-deck were
smashed to bits; burning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> fell all
round us and we were enveloped in an
impenetrable smoke. At the time we
did not know what had happened, but
afterwards we learned that it was the
foremost funnel which had fallen.</p>

<p>The terrified signalmen, losing their
presence of mind, huddled together right
under the falling spar-deck, and carried
us with them in their rush. It took
some time before we could compel
them to stop and listen to reason.</p>

<p><em>It was now 2.30 p.m.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
When the smoke had somewhat
cleared I tried to go to the poop to
see what had happened to the after
turret, but along the upper deck no
communication between bow and stern
was possible.</p>

<p>I attempted to pass through the upper
battery, whence to the poop the nearest
way was through the Admiral’s cabin,
but here the staff officers’ quarters were
burning furiously. Turning back, I met
Flag Lieutenant Kruijanoffsky on the
ladder hurrying downwards.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to?”</p>

<p>“Into the steering compartment; the
rudder is disabled,” he shouted to me
in passing.</p>

<p>“That is all that is wanting,” thought
I to myself, rushing up on deck.</p>

<p>Quickly going on to the fore-bridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
I could not at first get my bearings,
because, not far to starboard, our fleet
was steaming past, bearing on an opposite
course. The <i>Navarin</i>,—which ought to
have been astern—was now coming up
to us, going at full speed and cutting
through a big breaker. She especially
impressed herself on my memory. It
was evident that, owing to our steering gear
being out of order, we had turned
nearly 16 points.</p>

<p>The line of our fleet was very irregular
and the intervals varied, especially in the
3rd squadron. I could not see the
leading ships; they were to windward
of us and hidden by the smoke of the
fires. The enemy was also in the same
direction. Taking my bearings by the
sun and wind, I should say that our
fleet was steering approximately S.E.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
and the enemy stood to the N.E.
of us.</p>

<p>In the event of the flag-ship falling
out of the line during the battle, the
torpedo-boats <i>Biedovy</i> and <i>Buistry</i> were
immediately to come to her assistance
in order to take off the Admiral and
staff and put them on board an uninjured
ship. But, however much I looked on
either side, no torpedo-boats were to
be seen. Could we signal? But with
what? All means of signalling had
long since been destroyed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though we were unable
to see the enemy on account of the
smoke, they had a good view of us, and
concentrated their fire on the battered
battleship in the hope of sinking us.
Shells simply poured upon us—a
veritable whirlwind of fire and iron.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Lying almost stationary in the water,
and slowly working her engines so as to
get on the proper course and follow the
fleet, the <i>Suvoroff</i> offered her battered
sides in turn to the enemy, firing wildly
from those of her guns which were still
serviceable, and, alas! they were few
in number. The following is what
Japanese eye-witnesses wrote about us:<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p><blockquote>

<p>“On leaving the line the flag-ship,
though burning badly, still steamed
after the fleet, but under the fire we
brought to bear upon her, she rapidly
lost her foremast and both funnels,
besides being completely enveloped in
flames and smoke. She was so battered
that scarcely any one would have taken
her for a ship, and yet, even in this
pitiful condition, like the flag-ship which
she was, she never ceased to fire as
much as possible with such of her guns
as were serviceable.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I will quote another extract from a
report on the operations of Admiral
Kamimura’s squadron:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The <i>Suvoroff</i>, subjected to the fire
of both our squadrons, left the line.
Her upper part was riddled with holes,
and she was entirely enveloped in smoke.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Her masts had fallen and her funnels
came down one after the other. She
was unable to steer, and her fires increased
in density every moment. But,
even outside the fighting line, she still
continued firing, so that our bravest
sailors credited her with making a
plucky resistance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And now to return to my personal
observations and impressions.</p>

<p>Amidst the rumbling fire of our own
guns, the bursting of the enemy’s shells,
and the roaring of the flames, I was,
of course, unable to think about the
direction to which we were turning—whether
to or from the wind, but I
soon found out. When the battleship,
turning on her course, lay stern on to
the wind, the smoke from the flames
of the burning spar-deck leapt right up
to the fore-bridge where I was standing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
While occupied in looking for the
torpedo-boats, I had probably not noticed
the danger creeping towards me, and only
realised it on finding myself enveloped
in an impenetrable smoke. Burning air
parched my face and hands, while a
caustic smell of burning almost blinded
me. Breathing was impossible. I felt
I must save myself, but to do so I had
to go through the flames, for there was
no other way on to the poop. For a
moment the thought flashed across me
to jump from the bridge on to the
forward 12-inch turret, but to remember
where I was, to choose places to which
and whence to jump, was impossible.
How did I get out of this hell?
Perhaps some of the crew who had
seen me on the bridge dragged me
out! How I arrived on the upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
battery on a well-known spot near the
ship’s ikon, I can’t remember, and I
can’t imagine!</p>

<p>Having recovered my breath, drunk
some water and rubbed my eyes, I
looked about. It seemed quite pleasant
here. The large ikon case was still
unbroken, and with the exception of
the first shell which had destroyed the
temporary dressing station, the quiet of
this little corner had apparently been
undisturbed. Among some of the crew
who were standing by I recognised a
few of Demchinsky’s signalmen, and, in
reply to my enquiries as to his whereabouts,
they told me that having been
wounded he had made his way to the
hospital.</p>

<p>They were standing silently and outwardly
were calm, but from the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
in which they looked at me I noticed
that they were all possessed by some
undefined feeling of fear, as well as of
expectation and hope. They appeared
to believe, or to wish to believe that I
was still able to issue the necessary
order which would save them, and so
they waited. But what order could
I give? I might advise them to
go below—to take cover under the
armoured deck and await their fate,
but this they could have done of
their own accord. They wanted a
different order, for they still felt
themselves indispensable to the fight,
if it were to be continued. These
“tempered” men were just the men
we wanted.</p>

<p>And to me, indeed, it seemed useless
as well as cruel to shatter their belief—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
stamp out the last spark of hope—to
tell them the hard truth—to say, in
fact, that it was of no use our fighting,
and that all was over. No! I couldn’t!
On the contrary, I was filled with a
desire to mislead them—to feed that
flame of hope. Rather let them die in
the happy consciousness of victory, life,
and glory, coming perhaps in a few
moments.</p>

<p>As already said, the place where
the church was usually rigged<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>—and
which the doctor had (so unluckily)
selected for his temporary dressing station—had
been fairly fortunate, but now,
abaft the centre 6-inch turrets, the
fire had commenced to make its way.
Proceeding thither, we set to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
dragging away the burning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>,
extinguishing it, or throwing it overboard
through the huge holes in the
ship’s side. Finding an undamaged
water-main and a piece of a hose (without
a nozzle), we worked quietly and in
earnest. We extinguished some burning
furniture, but alongside it, behind
the thin, red-hot, steel partition separating
us from the officers’ quarters, another
fire burst forth, whose roar could at
times be heard even amidst the noise
of the battle. Occasionally a man fell
wounded, and either lay where he was,
or got up and walked or crawled to
the ladder leading below. No attention
was paid to him—What mattered it?
one more, one less!</p>

<p>How long we were thus employed—five,
ten, or fifteen minutes—I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
know, but suddenly the thought occurred
to me, “The conning tower—what is
happening there?”</p>

<p>I went up quickly, fatigue and depression
at once vanishing. My mind
was as clear as possible, and I saw at
once that, as the smoke was pouring
through the great rents on the port side,
the starboard must be the windward side.
I proceeded thither. Creeping with
difficulty on to the upper deck through
the torn hatchway, I scarcely recognised
the place where a short time since we
had stood with Demchinsky. Movement
was literally impossible. Astern, the spar-deck
had fallen down and was burning in
a bright flame on the deck; in front of
me was a heap of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>. The ladders
to the bridge had gone and the starboard
end of the bridge had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
destroyed; even the gangway under the
bridge on the other side was blocked.
I was obliged to go below again and
come up on the port side. Here,
matters were rather better, as, although
fallen and burning, the pieces of the
spar-deck were not scattered about in
such confusion as on the other side.
The 6-inch turret appeared to be still uninjured,
and was keeping up a hot fire;
the ladder to the bridge was whole, but
blocked with burning hammocks, which
I at once set five or six men, who
were following me, to throw into the
water standing on the deck. Suddenly
a shell whistled past us, quite close.
Everything seemed to start up, and
splinters rained upon us. “That must
be in the 6-inch turret,” thought I to
myself, half closing my eyes, and holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
my breath so as not to swallow the
gas. Sure enough, as the smoke cleared
away, only one helpless-looking gun stuck
defiantly out of the turret, while out of
the armoured door of the latter came
its commander, Lieutenant Danchich.</p>

<p>“Mine’s done for too; the muzzle of
one has been carried away, and the
elevating gear of the other is smashed.”</p>

<p>Going to the door I looked in. Of
the gun’s crew two lay huddled up in
a curious manner, while one sat motionless,
staring with wide-open eyes, holding
his wounded side with both hands. A
gun captain, with a worried, business-like
look, was extinguishing some burning
cloths.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I want to go to the conning tower.”</p>

<p>“Why? There’s no one there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
“No one! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact. Bogdanoff has just passed
through; he said it was all smashed to
pieces—had caught fire, and they’d
abandoned it. He went out just as the
bridge fell in—right on to me—I wasn’t
touched—lucky!”</p>

<p>“Where’s the Admiral?”</p>

<p>At this moment there was another
explosion quite close to me, and something
from behind hit me in the right
leg. It was not hard, and I felt no
pain. I turned round to look, but none
of my men were to be seen. Were
they killed, or had they gone below?</p>

<p>“Haven’t we any stretchers?” I heard
Danchich ask anxiously.</p>

<p>“For whom?” I said.</p>

<p>“Why! for you. You’re bleeding.”</p>

<p>Looking down I saw that my right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
leg was standing in a pool of blood,
but the leg itself felt sound enough.</p>

<p><em>It was 3 p.m.</em></p>

<p>“Can you manage to go? Stop—I’ll
tell off some one to go with you,” said
Danchich, making what seemed to me
an unnecessary fuss.</p>

<p>I was annoyed, and angrily said:
“Who wants to be accompanied?” and
bravely started to go down the ladder,
not realising what had happened. When
a small splinter had wounded me in
the waist at the beginning of the fight,
it had hurt me; but this time I felt
nothing.</p>

<p>Later, in the hospital, when carried
there on a stretcher, I understood why
it is that during a fight one hears
neither groans nor shouts. All that
comes afterwards. Apparently our feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
have strict limits for receiving
external impressions, being even deeply
impressed by an absurd sentence. A
thing can be so painful that you feel
nothing, so terrible that you fear nothing.</p>

<p>Having passed through the upper and
lower batteries, I descended to the mess
deck (under the armoured one), to the
hospital, but I involuntarily went back
to the ladder.</p>

<p>The mess deck was full of wounded.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
They were standing, sitting, lying—some
on mattresses put ready beforehand—some
on hastily spread tarpaulins—some
on stretchers—some just anyhow. Here
it was that they first began to feel.
The dreadful noise of deep sighs and
half-stifled groans was audible in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
close, damp air, which smelt of something
sour and disgustingly sickly. The
electric light seemed scarcely able to
penetrate this stench. Ahead somewhere,
in white coats stained with red
splotches, busy figures were moving
about, and towards them all these piles
of flesh, clothes, and bones turned, and
in their agony dragged themselves,
expecting something from them. It
seemed as if a cry, motionless, voiceless,
but intelligible, a cry which
reached to one’s very soul, a request
for help, for a miracle, for relief from
suffering—though at the price of a
speedy death—rose up on all sides.</p>

<p>I did not stop to wait my turn, and,
not wishing to put myself before others,
quickly went up the ladder to the lower
battery, where I met the Flag Captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
who had his head bandaged. (He had
been wounded in the back of the neck
by three splinters.)</p>

<p>On enquiry I learned that at the
same time as the steering gear had
been injured and the flag-ship had left
her place, the Admiral and Vladimirsky
were wounded in the head in the
conning tower. The latter had gone
below to get his wounds dressed, and
had been succeeded in command by
Bogdanoff, the third lieutenant. The
Admiral’s orders were to steer after the
fleet.</p>

<p>The fore-bridge was struck by numerous
projectiles. Splinters of shells, which
penetrated in large quantities under the
mushroom-shaped roof of the conning
tower, had destroyed all the instruments
in it, and had broken the compass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
but luckily the telegraph to one engine
and the voice-tube to the other were
still working. The bridge had caught
fire, and the hammocks—with which we
had proposed to protect ourselves from
splinters—as well as the small chart
house behind the conning tower, were
also burning. The heat became unbearable,
and what was worse—the thick
smoke prevented our seeing, which,
without a compass, made it impossible
to keep on in any particular direction.
The only thing left for us to do was
to steer from the lower fighting position
and abandon the conning tower for
some place whence one could see. At
this time there were in the conning
tower the Admiral, the Flag Captain,
and the Flag Navigating Officer—all
three wounded; Lieutenant Bogdanoff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Sub-Lieutenant Shishkin and one sailor
apparently uninjured. Bogdanoff was
the first to come out of the tower
on the port side of the bridge, and,
pluckily pushing aside the burning
hammocks, he dashed forward, disappearing
into the flames, which were leaping
upward. Following after him, the Flag
Captain turned to the starboard side of
the bridge, but here everything was
destroyed; the ladder was gone and
there was no road. Only one way
remained—below, into the lower fighting
position. With difficulty dragging
aside the dead bodies which were lying
on the deck, they raised the hatch over
the armoured tube, and through it let
themselves down into the lower fighting
position. Rozhdestvensky, although
wounded in the head, back and right leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
(besides several small splinter wounds),
bore himself most cheerfully. From the
lower fighting position the Flag Captain
proceeded to the hospital, while the
Admiral—leaving here Colonel Filipinoffsky
(the Flag Navigating Officer), who
was slightly wounded, with orders that,
in the absence of other instructions, he
was to steer on the old course—went off
to look for a place from which he could
watch the fight.</p>

<p>The upper deck being a mass of
burning wreckage, he was unable to pass
beyond where the ship’s ikon hung
in the upper battery. From here
he tried to get through to the centre
6-inch turret on the port side, but was
unable to, so proceeded to the starboard
turret. It was here that he received the
wound which caused him so much pain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
(A splinter struck his left leg, severing
the main nerve and paralysing the ball
of the foot.) He was carried into the
turret and seated on a box, but he still
had sufficient strength at once to ask
why the turret was not firing, and to
order Kruijanoffsky, who then came up, to
find the gun captains, fall in the crews,
and open fire. The turret, however,
had been damaged and would not turn.
Kruijanoffsky, who had just returned
from the disabled steering gear, reported
that the rudder had been repaired, but
that all three communicators with it
were cut. Also there were no means of
conveying orders from the lower fighting
position to the steering gear, as voice-tubes
did not exist, the electric indicators
were injured, and the telephone refused
to work. It became necessary to steer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
from the lower fighting position, which
meant to turn round in circles rather
than to go ahead.</p>

<p>The events which I am relating in
chronological order, and in the form of
a connected narrative were, of course, not
recorded in this manner by me, but were
told me at different times and by different
people. To attempt, however, to give
in detail these half-finished sentences, interrupted
suddenly by the burst of a shell
close by—the jerked-out remarks thrown
at one in passing—the separate words
accompanied by gestures, more eloquent
far than any words—would be impossible
and useless. At that moment,
when every one’s nerves were highly
strung, an exclamation or wave of
the hand took the place of many
words, fully and clearly interpreting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the thought which it was desired to
express. Put on paper they would be
unintelligible.</p>

<p>Time was measured by seconds; and
there was no occasion for words.</p>

<p>There was no actual fire in the lower
battery as yet; it was coming from above.
But through the hatches, torn funnel
casings, and shot holes in the middle
deck, burning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> was falling below,
and here and there small fires burst
forth. The men, however, set to work,
most pluckily rigging up cover for the
wireless fighting station with sacks of
coal. The trollies with the 12-pounder
cartridges which had been collected here
(as the ammunition supply rails had been
damaged) were in danger of catching fire,
so several had to be thrown overboard.
However, despite the difficulties in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
extinguishing the fire, it was at length
got under.</p>

<p>Besides spreading in the natural course
it was assisted, of course, by the enemy’s
projectiles, which continued to rain upon
us. The losses among the crew still
continued to be heavy, and I myself
was wounded in the left elbow, as well
as being struck by two small splinters
in the side.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>I remembered that in the event of
the flag-ship leaving the line, the torpedo-boats,
<i>Biedovy</i> and <i>Buistry</i>, were to come
to her in order to transfer the Admiral
and his staff to another and uninjured
ship. In such circumstances, in order
to avoid confusion, until the flag had
been transferred or until a signal had
been made as to the handing over of
the command, the fleet was to be led
by the ship following the one which
had fallen out of the line.</p>

<p>I do not presume to be able to
say whether our other ships could see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
that no torpedo-boats had come up to
the <i>Suvoroff</i>! Whether they could all
see that no signal was possible from
the battered, burning battleship, minus
funnels and masts! Whether it ought
in consequence to have been taken for
granted that the command naturally
devolved on the next ship according to
seniority! and whether she should in
some way or another have shown that
she had taken over command! In any
case the <i>Alexander</i> (more correctly,
her captain, Bukvostoff) carried out
the orders and did her duty. After
the flag-ship had fallen out of the
line, receiving no fresh instructions,
she took the lead and continued the
fight.</p>

<p>From the time when I saw the
<i>Alexander</i> passing close to us on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
south-easterly course, she steamed for
twenty minutes, gradually inclining to
the south in order to prevent the enemy
from getting ahead and crossing her
T. At the same time the Japanese,
elated by their first success, again
endeavoured to realise their main idea
of a concentrated attack on the leading
ship, and so wrapped up were they
in this objective that they went ahead
too fast, leaving nothing to prevent the
<i>Alexander</i> passing astern in a north-easterly
direction.</p>

<p>She immediately took advantage of
this and turned sharp to the north, calculating
with luck to fall in force upon their
rear and subject them to a raking fire.
The Japanese in their reports fix the
time of this movement differently;
some at 2.40 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, others at 2.50 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
(the moment of the sinking of the
<i>Oslyabya</i>, which under the concentrated
fire of six of Admiral Kamimura’s
armoured cruisers had left the line
even before the <i>Suvoroff</i>). According
to my own calculations, the latter time
was the more likely to be correct.
If the enemy’s fleet had turned “in
succession,” as it had done at the
commencement of the battle, this
manœuvre of the <i>Alexander’s</i> might
have been successful, but, realising
the gravity of the moment, Togo, on
this occasion, gave the order to turn
16 points to port “together.” The
manœuvre was not altogether successful.
The 1st squadron (<i>Mikasa</i>, <i>Shikishima</i>,
<i>Fuji</i>, <i>Asahi</i>, <i>Kasuga</i>, and <i>Nisshin</i>)
performed it correctly, but Kamimura,
with his cruisers—probably not having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
made out the signal and expecting the
order to turn “in succession” on to
the former course—quickly passed our
fleet as well as his own battleships
(which were on the opposite course),
and masked their fire. He then had
plenty of room to turn (he turned “in
succession”) and, after overtaking the
battleships, to form single column line
ahead.</p>

<p>For a moment confusion prevailed,
for which the Japanese might have
paid dearly, but owing to its condition
our fleet was unable to reap the advantage.
Making full use of their speed,
the Japanese not only succeeded in
righting their distances, but attained
their object, <i>i.e.</i> came out across the
<i>Alexander’s</i> course, forcing her to the
south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Through the starboard portholes of
our batteries we were now able plainly
to see the <i>Alexander</i>, which was almost
on our beam and steering straight
towards us—the remainder following
her. The distance rapidly diminished,
and with our glasses we could clearly
see her battered sides, broken bridges,
burning cabins and spar-deck, but her
funnels and masts were still standing.
After her came the <i>Borodino</i>, burning
furiously. The enemy had already
succeeded in forging ahead, and we
now lay between the fleets. Our ships
approached from starboard, <i>i.e.</i> the port
side of the <i>Suvoroff</i>, and we came
under a hot fire. Our forward 12-inch
turret (the only one that was
now serviceable) took an active part
in the fight, and no attention was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
paid to falling shells. I was wounded
in the left leg, but only looked down
with regret at my torn boot! We all
waited, holding our breath, watching
the Japanese fire, which was apparently
concentrated on the <i>Alexander</i>. At
times she seemed completely enveloped
in flames and brown smoke, while
round her the sea literally boiled,
throwing up great pillars of water.
Nearer and nearer she came, till the
distance was scarcely 2,000 yards. Then—one
after another, we saw a whole
series of shells strike her fore-bridge and
port 6-inch turret, and turning sharply to
starboard she steamed away, having
almost reversed her course, while after
her went the <i>Borodino</i>, <i>Orel</i>, and
others. The turn was hastily made,
being neither “in succession” nor “all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
together,”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and the line ahead formation
was not maintained. A deafening
clamour resounded in our batteries.</p>

<p>“They’ve given it up. They are
going off. They couldn’t do it,” I heard
on all sides.</p>

<p>These simple folk had, of course,
imagined that our fleet was returning
to the flag-ship in order to rescue her.
Their disenchantment was distressing to
witness, but still more was it distressing
to realise the true significance of what
had happened.</p>

<p>How pitiless is memory!—A scene never
to be forgotten came clearly and distinctly
before my eyes—just such another
scene—the same awful picture. After
Prince Utomsky’s signal on the 10th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
August our battleships had steamed
north-west in the same disorder and
just as hurriedly.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t do it!”</p>

<p>And the awful, fatal word, which I
had not even dared to think, rang in my
brain, and seemed to be written in letters
of fire on the smoke, on the battered sides,
and even on the pale, confused faces of
the crew.</p>

<p>Bogdanoff was standing beside me. I
caught his eye, and we understood one
another. He commenced to talk of it,
but suddenly stopping, looked round,
and said in an unnaturally calm voice:
“We seem to be heeling over to
port.”</p>

<p>“Yes—some 8 degrees,” I answered,
and, pulling out my watch and note-book,
jotted down:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> “<em>3.25 p.m.—a heavy
list to port, and a bad fire in the upper
battery.</em>”</p>

<p>I often afterwards thought: why is it
that we hide things from one another and
from ourselves? Why did not Bogdanoff
express his thoughts aloud? and why
was it that I did not dare to write even
in my own note-book the cheerless word
“<em>Defeat</em>”? Perhaps within us there still
existed some dim hope of a miracle, of
some kind of surprise which would change
everything? I do not know.</p>

<p>After the <i>Alexander</i> had turned, the
enemy’s ships also turned 16 points
“together,” and this time the manœuvre
was successfully performed—so successfully,
in fact, that it seemed as if
they were merely at drill and not in
action.</p>

<p>Steering on an opposite course, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
passed under our bows, and from the
<i>Suvoroff</i> it seemed as if we could almost
cut into their column. We inclined to
starboard after our fleet. (This was,
of course, only imagination, for, not being
able to steer by surrounding objects but
only by compass in the lower fighting
position, we were in reality not moving
ahead, but were only turning to starboard
and to port; remaining almost in the
same place.) In passing close to us,
the enemy did not miss his opportunity
of concentrating his fire on the obstinate
ship which refused to sink, and it was,
apparently, now that our last turret,
the forward 12-inch, was destroyed.
According to Japanese reports their
torpedo-boats came up at the same time
as their fleet and attacked us unsuccessfully,
but I did not see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
A shell entered the gun port of the
fourth (from the bows) 12-pounder
gun of the lower battery on the port
side, and it was a lucky shot, for in
addition to carrying away the gun it
penetrated the armoured deck. The
water poured into the damaged port,
and being unable to run back on account
of the list to port, fell through this hole
into the mess deck, which was most
dangerous.</p>

<p>Bogdanoff was the first to call
attention to it, and we at once started
to make some kind of an obstacle
out of coal sacks, and anything else
that was handy, so as to cover the
hole and stop the water getting in.
I say “we,” because the few hands
left in the battery could not be
brought to obey orders. They huddled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in corners in a sort of stupor, and
we had almost to drag them out by
force, and were obliged to work ourselves
to set them an example. We
were joined by Flag Torpedo Officer
Lieutenant Leontieff and Demchinsky,
but the latter could only encourage us
with words, as both his wrists were
bandaged.</p>

<p><em>At 3.40 p.m.</em> a cheer broke out in the
battery, which was taken up all over the
vessel, but we were unable to ascertain
what had caused it or whence it had
originated. Rumour had it that one
of the enemy’s ships had been seen to
sink; some even said two—not one.
Whatever may have been the truth,
this cheering had the effect of quickly
changing the feeling on board, and the
depression from which we had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
suffering, both on account of the fire
which we had seen poured into the
<i>Alexander</i>, and because of the departure
of the fleet, vanished. Men who had
been skulking in corners, deaf to the
commands and even requests of their
officers, now came running to us asking:
“Where could they be of use, and what
at?” They even joked and laughed:
“Hullo! that’s only a 6-inch! No more
‘portmanteaus’ now!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, since the enemy’s main
body had steamed off, we had only been
subjected to the fire of Admiral Dewa’s
light cruisers, which, in comparison to
what we had been under before, was
almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>Commander V. V. Ignatzius had remained
below after the second wound
in his head had been dressed, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
unable to restrain himself at such a
moment, paying no heed to the doctors,
he ran up the ladder into the battery,
shouting: “Follow me, lads! To the fire—to
the fire! we have only got to get
it under!”</p>

<p>Various non-combatants in the mess
deck (belonging to the hospital), and
men who were slightly wounded and
had gone down to get their wounds
dressed, doubled after him. A chance
shot struck the hatchway, and when
the smoke cleared away neither ladder,
nor Commander, nor men with him,
were in existence!</p>

<p>But even this bloody episode did not
damp the men’s ardour. It was only
one in a hundred others.</p>

<p>In the lower battery where, owing to
insufficiency of hands, fires momentarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
became more numerous, men came,
and work went merrily. Of the ship’s
officers, besides Bogdanoff, there came
Lieutenant Vuiruboff, junior torpedo
officer, a robust-looking youth, who,
in an unbuttoned coat, rushed about
everywhere giving the lead, while his
shout of “Tackle it! Stick to it!”
resounding amongst smoke and flames,
gave strength to the workers. Zotoff
came for a short time; he was wounded
in the left side and arm. Prince
Tsereteli looked out from the mess
deck, asking how things were going.
Kozakevitch was carried past, wounded
a second time, and now dangerously.
My servant, Matrosoff, appeared and
almost dragged me by force to the
dressing station. I got rid of him
with difficulty, telling him to go at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
once to my cabin and get me some
cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir!” he said, going
off as he was bid, and we did not
meet again.</p>

<p>“To the guns! Torpedo-boats
astern! To the guns!” was shouted on
deck.</p>

<p>It was easy to say, “To the guns!”
but of the twelve 12-pounder guns
in the lower battery only one, on the
starboard side, was now serviceable, and
there was no chance of using it.
The torpedo-boats carefully came up
from astern (according to the Japanese,
this was about 4.20 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>), but in the
light gun battery aft (behind the ward-room)
there was still one uninjured
12-pounder. Maximoff, a volunteer,
on whom the command of the battery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
had devolved after the officers had fallen,
opened a hot fire, and the torpedo-boats,
seeing that this strange-looking,
battered vessel could still show her teeth,
steamed off to wait for a more favourable
opportunity.</p>

<p>This event suggested to me the
idea of noting the means we had
with which to protect ourselves against
torpedo attack, or, more properly, to
what degree of helplessness we had
arrived. There were in the lower
battery about fifty men of the crew—all
of various ratings. Among them,
however, were two gun captains. Of
the guns, only one was really serviceable,
though the gun captains proposed
to “repair” another by substituting for
its injured parts pieces from the other
ten which were quite unserviceable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
There was also Maximoff’s gun in the
stern light gun battery.</p>

<p>Having finished my inspection of the
lower battery I went through the upper
to the forward light gun battery (not
one of the turrets was fit for action),
and I was struck with the picture it
presented, illustrating, more clearly than
I had yet seen, the action of the enemy’s
projectiles.</p>

<p>There were no fires; everything that
could ignite had already been burned.
The four 12-pounder guns had been
torn off their mountings, and in vain
I looked on them for marks of direct
hits. None could be seen. The havoc
had clearly been caused by the force
of the explosion, and not by the
impact of the shell. How was this?
Neither mines nor pyroxylene were stored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
in the battery, so the enemy’s shells
must have exploded with the force of
mines.</p>

<p>To my readers, walking about the
crippled wreck of a ship like this and
inspecting the damage done may appear
strange, but it must be remembered that
a peculiar, even extraordinary condition
of affairs prevailed on board. “So fearful
as not to be in the least terrible.” To
every one it was perfectly clear that all
was over. Neither past or future existed.
We lived only in the actual moment,
and were possessed with an overpowering
desire to do something, no matter
what.</p>

<p>Having again gone down to the lower
battery, I was proceeding to the stern
light gun battery, which I wished to
inspect, when I met Kursel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Verner von Kursel, a Courlandian by
birth, and a general favourite with every
one in the <i>Suvoroff’s</i> ward-room, had
been in the merchant service almost
since his cradle, and could speak every
language in Europe, though he was
equally bad at all of them. When they
chaffed him about this in the ward-room
he used to say quite seriously: “I think
that I’m better at German than any
other!”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> He had seen and been through
so much that he never lost his presence
of mind, and nothing prevented him
meeting his friends with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>And so now, nodding his head to me
in the distance, he cheerily asked:</p>

<p>“Well! How are you passing the
time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
“Badly,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s it, is it? They don’t seem
able to hit me yet, but I see that you
have been wounded.”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“Where are you off to?”</p>

<p>“To have a look at the light guns
in the stern and get some cigarettes
from my cabin; I have smoked all
I had.”</p>

<p>“To your cabin?” and Kursel grinned.
“I have just come from there, I’ll go
with you.”</p>

<p>Indeed, he seemed likely to be a
useful companion, as he knew the most
sheltered way.</p>

<p>Having got as far as the officers’
quarters, I stopped in amazement. Where
my cabin and the two adjoining ones
had been was an enormous hole! Kursel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
laughed heartily, thoroughly enjoying his
joke, but growing angry I waved my
hand and quickly retraced my steps.
Kursel overtook me in the battery and
offered me a cigar.</p>

<p>The fires in the lower battery had all
been got under and, encouraged by this
success, we determined to try our luck
in the upper battery. Two firemen
produced some new half-made hoses;
one end of them we fastened to the
water-main with wire, and the other
we tied to the nozzle. Then, armed
with these and using damp sacks to
protect us from the flames, we leaned
out through the church hatch whence,
having succeeded after some little time
in putting the fire out which had
been burning in the dressing station
we were able to go into the upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
battery. All hands worked splendidly,
and we soon had extinguished the fire
in the part assigned to the church.
Then another fire started abaft the
centre 6-inch turrets—the place which
had been selected, on account of its
being protected, for putting the cartridge
boxes of the 47-millimetre guns taken
down from the bridges. Their removal
had been well ordered, for no sooner
had we set about extinguishing the fire
which was now raging near them than
they began to explode. Several of the
men fell killed and wounded, and great
confusion at once ensued.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing—it will cease in a
moment,” said Kursel.</p>

<p>But explosions became more and
more frequent. The new hoses were
destroyed, one after the other, and then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
suddenly, quite close, there was a loud
crash, accompanied with the ring of
tearing iron. This was not a 6-inch shell,
but the “portmanteaus” again. The men
became seized with panic, and, listening
to nothing and nobody, rushed below.</p>

<p>When we went down into the lower
battery, bitterly disappointed at our want
of luck just when things seemed beginning
to go so well, something (it must
have been a splinter of some kind) struck
me in the side and I staggered.</p>

<p>“Wounded again?” enquired Kursel,
taking his cigar out of his mouth and
leaning tenderly over me.</p>

<p>I looked at him and thought: “Ah!
if only the whole fleet were composed
of men as cool as you are!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, having turned abruptly
away from the <i>Suvoroff</i>, our fleet had
steamed off, gradually inclining to starboard
so as not to give the Japanese
a chance of crossing its T, which they
evidently were trying to do. The consequence
was that both belligerents
moved on the arcs of two concentric
circles. Ours on the smaller—the
Japanese on the larger.</p>

<p><em>About 4 p.m.</em> it seemed as if fortune
for the last time was endeavouring to
smile upon us. In the midst of the
thick smoke which was pouring from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
damaged funnels, from the guns which
were in action, and from the fires on board,
and which mingled with the mist still
lying on the water, the enemy’s main
force seemed to separate from and lose
sight of ours. Japanese reports, of which
I have availed myself, comment very
briefly and somewhat obscurely on this
event. Nothing is clear save that Togo,
believing our fleet was somehow breaking
through to the north, went thither
in search of it. Kamimura being of
a different opinion proceeded with his
cruisers in a south and south-westerly
direction. At least, the above will alone
explain the glowing panegyrics which I
find in the reports entitled “The Prowess
of Admiral Kamimura.” If it had not
been for this “prowess,” possibly the
fight would have ended on 27th May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
and our fleet would have had time to
close up and recover.</p>

<p>Steering on a south and afterwards
south-westerly course, Kamimura heard a
heavy cannonade proceeding to the west.
He accordingly hastened there to find
Admiral Kataoka attacking (till now
with little success) our cruisers and
transports. Kamimura, commencing to
take an active part in the fight, then
came upon our main body, which,
having almost described a circle with a
5-mile diameter, was returning to the
spot where the <i>Alexander</i> had made
her abrupt turn, and round which the
<i>Suvoroff</i> was so helplessly wandering.</p>

<p><em>It was about 5 p.m.</em></p>

<p>I was standing with Kursel in the
lower battery smoking and talking of
subjects, not in any way connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
the fight, when suddenly we seemed to
be in the midst of the fleet, which, devoid
of all formation, was moving northwards.
Some ships passed to starboard—some
to port—the <i>Borodino</i>—Captain
Serebryanikoff—leading. The <i>Alexander</i>,
badly battered and with a heavy list—lying
so low that the water almost came
into the portholes of the lower battery—was
still fighting, firing with such of
her guns as were serviceable. I did not
see her, but was told that the whole of
her bows, from the stem to the 12-inch
turret, were torn open.</p>

<p>Having closed up to the main body,
the cruisers and transports steamed
astern and somewhat to port—attacked
by detachments of Admiral Kataoko’s
squadron. (In addition to Kataoko himself,
Admirals Dewa, Uriu, and Togo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
junior were also there.) Kamimura
remained further to starboard, <i>i.e.</i> to the
east—also heading for the north.</p>

<p>“Portmanteaus” were still raining on
us. Word had been received from the
engine-room that the men were being
suffocated and rapidly falling out, as the
ventilators were bringing down smoke
instead of air; soon there would be no
men left to work the engines! Meanwhile,
the electric light grew dim, and
it was reported from the dynamo engines
that steam was scarce.</p>

<p>“Torpedo-boats ahead!”</p>

<p>We rushed to our only gun (the other
had been found to be past repair), but
it turned out to be the <i>Buiny</i>, which
happened to be passing us, and was on
her own initiative coming alongside the
crippled battleship to enquire if she
could be of any assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Kruijanoffsky was ordered by the flag-captain,
who was standing on the embrasure,
to semaphore to her (with his
arms) to “take off the Admiral.”</p>

<p>I was watching the <i>Buiny’s</i> movements
from the battery, when suddenly
the Admiral’s messenger, Peter Poochkoff,
hastened towards me.</p>

<p>“Please come to the turret, sir! a
torpedo-boat has come alongside, but
the Admiral won’t leave.”</p>

<p>I ought to mention here that Rozhdestvensky
had not been to the dressing
station, and none of us knew how badly
he was wounded because, to all enquiries
when he was hit, he angrily replied that
it was only a trifle. He still remained
sitting on the box in the turret, where
he had been placed.</p>

<p>At times he would look up to ask how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the battle was progressing, and then
would again sit silently, with his eyes
on the ground. Considering, however,
the state the ship was in, what else
could he do? His conduct seemed most
natural, and it never occurred to us that
these questions were merely momentary
flashes of energy—short snatches of
consciousness.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the torpedo-boat
being reported, he pulled himself together,
and gave the order to “Collect the staff,”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
with perfect clearness, but afterwards,
he only frowned, and would listen to
nothing.</p>

<p>Assisted by Kursel I crept through
the open half-port of the lower battery,
out on to the starboard embrasure in
front of the centre 6-inch turret. I was
in need of help, as my right leg had
become very painful, and I could only
limp on the heel of my left.</p>

<p>The boatswain and some sailors were
at work on the embrasure, sweeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
overboard the burning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> which had
fallen from the spar-deck above. Lying
off our starboard bow, and some three or
four cables distant, was the <i>Kamchatka</i>.
Kamimura’s cruisers were pouring as
heavy a fire into her as into us, but she
was an easier victim.</p>

<p>The <i>Buiny</i> kept close alongside,
dancing up and down. Her Captain,
Kolomeytseff, shouting through his
speaking trumpet, asked: “Have you a
boat in which to take off the Admiral?
We haven’t!” To this the flag Captain
and Kruijanoffsky made some reply.
I looked at the turret. Its armoured
door was damaged and refused to open
properly, so that it was very doubtful
if anything as big as a man could
get through. The Admiral was sitting
huddled up, with his eyes on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
ground; his head was bandaged in a
blood-stained towel.</p>

<p>“Sir, the torpedo-boat is alongside!
we must go,” I said.</p>

<p>“Call Filipinoffsky,” he replied, without
moving.</p>

<p>Rozhdestvensky evidently intended to
lead the fleet after hoisting his flag on
another ship, and therefore wanted to
have with him the flag navigating
officer, who was responsible for the dead-reckoning
and safety of manœuvres.</p>

<p>“He will be here in a minute; they
have gone for him.” The Admiral
merely shook his head.</p>

<p>I have not laid stress on the fact that
before transferring him to another ship
it was necessary to try and arrange
some means of getting him there.</p>

<p>Kursel, with the boatswain and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
or three sailors, had got hold of some
half-burned hammocks and rope from
the upper battery, and with these had
begun to lash together something in
the shape of a raft on which to lower
the Admiral into the water and put
him on board the torpedo-boat. It
was risky, but nothing else was to
hand.</p>

<p>The raft was ready. Filipinoffsky
appeared, and I hurried to the turret.</p>

<p>“Come out, sir! Filipinoffsky is
here.”</p>

<p>Rozhdestvensky gazed at us, shaking
his head, and not uttering a syllable.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. No.”</p>

<p>We were at a loss how to proceed.</p>

<p>“What are you staring at?” suddenly
said Kursel. “Carry him; can’t you see
he is badly wounded?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
It seemed as if it was only for these
words and the impulse they supplied for
which we were waiting. There was a
hum of voices and much bustling about.
Some forcing their way into the turret,
took hold of the Admiral by his arms
and raised him up, but no sooner had
he put his left leg to the ground than
he groaned and completely lost consciousness.
It was the best thing that could
have happened.</p>

<p>“Bring him along! Bring him along!
Splendid! Easy now! the devil! Take
him along the side! Get to the side,
can’t you? Stop—something’s cracking!
What? his coat is being torn! Carry
him along!” were the anxious shouts
one heard on all sides. Having taken off
the Admiral’s coat, they dragged him
with the greatest difficulty through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
narrow opening of the jammed door
out on to the after embrasure, and were
just proceeding to fasten him to the raft,
when Kolomeytseff did, what a man
does only once in his life, and then
when inspired. My readers who are
landsmen will not realise all the danger of
what we were to attempt, but sailors will
easily understand the risk. Kolomeytseff
brought his vessel alongside and to
windward of the mutilated battleship,
out of whose battered gun ports stuck
her crippled guns, and from whose
side projected the broken booms of
her torpedo-nets.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Dancing up and
down on the waves the torpedo-boat
at one moment rose till her deck was
almost on a level with the embrasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
then rapidly sank away below; next
moment she was carried away, and then
again was seen struggling towards us,
being momentarily in danger of staving
in her thin side against one of the
many projections from this motionless
mass.</p>

<p>The Admiral was carried hurriedly
from the after to the bow embrasure,
along the narrow gangway between the
turrets and the battered side of the
upper battery. From here, off the
backs of the men who were standing
by the open half-port, holding on to
the side, he was lowered down, almost
thrown, on board the torpedo-boat, at
a moment when she rose on a wave
and swung towards us.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
“Hurrah! the Admiral is on board!”
shouted Kursel, waving his cap.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered every one.</p>

<p>How I, with my wounded legs,
boarded her, I don’t remember. I can
only recollect that, lying on the hot
engine-room hatch between the funnels,
I gazed at the <i>Suvoroff</i>, unable to take
my eyes off her. It was one of those
moments which are indelibly impressed
upon the mind.</p>

<p>Our position alongside the <i>Suvoroff</i>
was extremely dangerous, as, besides
the risk of being crushed, we might,
at any moment, have been sunk by a
shell, for the Japanese still poured in
a hot fire upon both the flag-ship and
the <i>Kamchatka</i>. Several of the <i>Buiny’s</i>
crew had already been killed and
wounded with splinters, and a lucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
shot might at any moment send us to
the bottom.</p>

<p>“Push off quickly!” shouted Kursel
from the embrasure.</p>

<p>“Push off—push off—don’t waste a
moment—don’t drown the Admiral!”
bawled Bogdanoff, leaning over the side
and shaking his fist at our captain.</p>

<p>“Push off—push off!” repeated the
crew, looking out of the battery ports
and waving their caps.</p>

<p>Choosing a moment when she was
clear of the side, Kolomeytseff gave the
order “Full speed astern.”</p>

<p>Farewell shouts reached us from the
<i>Suvoroff</i>. I say from the “<i>Suvoroff</i>,”
but who would have recognised the,
till recently, formidable battleship in
this crippled mass, which was now
enveloped in smoke and flames?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Her mainmast was cut in half. Her
foremast and both funnels had been
completely carried away, while her high
bridges and galleries had been rent
in pieces, and instead of them shapeless
piles of distorted iron were heaped
upon the deck. She had a heavy list
to port, and, in consequence of it, we
could see the hull under the water-line
on her starboard side reddening
the surface of the water, while great
tongues of fire were leaping out of
numerous rents.</p>

<p>We rapidly steamed away, followed
by a brisk fire from those of the
enemy’s ships which had noticed our
movements.</p>

<p><em>It was 5.30 p.m.</em></p>

<p>As I have previously remarked, up
to the last moment in the <i>Suvoroff</i> we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
none of us were aware of the nature
of the Admiral’s wounds, and, therefore,
the immediate question on board the
<i>Buiny</i> was, which ship was he to board
in order to continue in command of the
fleet? When, however, the surgeon,
Peter Kudinoff, came to render first
aid, we at once learned of how the
matter lay, for Kudinoff declared that
his life was in danger; that he was
suffering from fracture of the skull—a
portion of it having entered his brain—and
that any jolt might have fatal
results. Taking into consideration the
condition of the weather—a fresh breeze
and a fairly heavy swell—he said it
would be impossible to transfer him
to another ship. Moreover, he was
unable to stand, and his general condition,
loss of power and memory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
wandering, and short flashes of consciousness,
rendered him incapable of any
action.</p>

<p>From the <i>Buiny’s</i> engine-room hatch,
on which I had chanced to take up my
position on going aboard, I proceeded
to the bridge, but found that I was
not able to stand here because of the
rolling, and could only lie. However,
while lying down, I was so in the way
of those on duty that the Commander
advised me in as nice a way as possible
to go elsewhere—to the hospital.</p>

<p>We were now overtaking the fleet,
and the flag Captain decided that before
making any signal, we must in spite
of above consult the Admiral, and this
was entrusted to me. Picking my way
astern with great difficulty, I went down
the ladder and looked into the Captain’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
cabin. The surgeon had finished dressing
the Admiral’s wounds, and the latter
was lying motionless in a hammock with
half-closed eyes. But he was still
conscious.</p>

<p>On my asking him if he felt strong
enough to continue in command, and
what ship he wished to board, he turned
towards me with an effort, and for a
while seemed trying to remember something.</p>

<p>“No—where am I? You can see—command—Nebogatoff,”
he muttered
indistinctly, and then, with a sudden
burst of energy, added, “Keep on Vladivostok—course
N.23°E.,” and again
relapsed into a stupor.</p>

<p>Having sent his reply to the flag
Captain (I don’t remember by whom,
but I think it was by Leontieff) I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
intended to remain in the ward-room,
but there was no room. All the cabins
and even the upper deck were full of
men, as, before coming to the <i>Suvoroff</i>,
the <i>Buiny</i> had picked up over 200 men
at the spot where the <i>Oslyabya</i> sank.
Amongst them were wounded sailors who
had been swimming about in the salt
water, and others who, when taken up,
had been half drowned. The latter,
contracted with cramp, and racked with
tormenting coughs and pains in their
chests, seemed with their bluish faces
to be in a worse plight than the most
badly wounded.</p>

<p>Passing on to the upper deck I seated
myself on a box by the ladder to the
officers’ quarters.</p>

<p>Signals were fluttering from our mast
and orders were being given by semaphore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
to the torpedo-boats, <i>Bezuprechny</i>
and <i>Biedovy</i>, which were now close up to
us.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> We had already caught up the fleet
and were steaming, together with the
transports, which were covered, ahead
and to starboard, by our cruisers. Still
further to starboard, and some 30 cables
off, was our main force. The <i>Borodino</i>
was leading, and after her came the <i>Orel</i>;
but the <i>Alexander</i> was nowhere to be
seen.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> In the distance, still further off,
could dimly be made out in the dusk,
which was now rapidly creeping on,
the silhouettes of the Japanese ships—steaming
parallel to us. The flashes of
their guns twinkled incessantly along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the line, but the stubborn fight was not
yet at an end!</p>

<p>Alongside of me I recognised an
officer of the <i>Oslyabya</i>, and asked him
what had actually caused his ship to
sink?</p>

<p>Waving his arm in a helpless sort of
way, and in a voice full of disgust, he
jerked out: “How? it’s not very pleasant
to remember. Absolutely no luck, that’s
what sunk her. Nothing but bad luck!
They shot straight enough—but it wasn’t
shooting. It wasn’t skill either. It
was luck—infernal luck! Three shells,
one after the other, almost in the same
identical spot—Imagine it! All of them
in the same place! All on the water-line
under the forward turret! Not
a hole—but a regular gateway! Three
of them penetrated her together. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
almost heeled over at once—then settled
under the water. A tremendous rush of
water and the partitions were naturally
useless. The devil himself couldn’t have
done anything!” he hysterically exclaimed,
and, covering his face with his
hands, went on deck.</p>

<p><em>About 7 p.m.</em> the enemy’s torpedo-boats
appeared across the course on
which our main force was steering, but
rapidly drew off as our cruisers opened
fire on them.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ve laid mines!” I
thought to myself, and turned on
my box, trying to make myself more
easy.</p>

<p>“The <i>Borodino</i>! Look! the <i>Borodino</i>!”
was shouted on all sides.</p>

<p>I raised myself, as quickly as possible
on my arm, but where the <i>Borodino</i> had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
been nothing was visible save a patch of
white foam!</p>

<p><em>It was 7.10 p.m.</em></p>

<p>The enemy’s fleet having turned sharply
to starboard, bore off to the east, and
in its place was a group of torpedo-boats,
which now surrounded us in a
semicircle from the north, east, and
west. Preparing to receive their attacks
from astern, our cruisers, and we
after them, gradually inclined to port,—and
then bore almost direct to the
west—straight towards the red sky.
(There was no compass near me.)</p>

<p><em>At 7.40 p.m.</em> I still was able to
see our battleships, steaming astern
of us devoid of formation, and defending
themselves from the approaching
torpedo-boats by firing. <em>This was my
last note.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Feeling weak from loss of blood and
from the inflammation of my wounds,
which were dirty and had not been
bandaged, I began to shiver. My head
swam, and I went below to get help.</p>

<p>And what of the <i>Suvoroff</i>? This is
how a Japanese report describes her last
moments:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the dusk, when our cruisers were
driving the enemy northwards, they
came upon the <i>Suvoroff</i> alone, at some
distance from the fight, heeling over
badly and enveloped in flames and
smoke. The division (Captain-Lieutenant
Fudzimoto) of torpedo-boats,
which was with our cruisers, was at
once sent to attack her. Although
much burned and still on fire—although
she had been subjected to so many
attacks, having been fired at by all the
fleet (in the full sense of the word)—although
she had only one serviceable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
gun—she still opened fire, showing her
determination to defend herself to the
last moment of her existence—so long,
in fact, as she remained above water.
At length, about 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, after our
torpedo-boats had twice attacked her,
she went to the bottom.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Cruel irony! We were attempting to force our way
through to our <em>base</em>, and had been ordered to take with
us, if possible, everything in the way of materials and

The railway was only able with difficulty to supply
the army, and we were under no circumstances to count
upon its help.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “Together” has a literal meaning: the ships all
change direction simultaneously to the same side and at the
same angle. By doing this they take up a new formation,
parallel to their former line, and to starboard or to port of
it, moving ahead or not according to the size of the angle
of turning. Shortly after changing direction the order is
again given to turn “together” at the same angle, but
to the opposite side, and the ships thus find themselves
once more in single column line ahead, but at some
distance to starboard or to port of their original course.
</p>
<p>
“Together” is the direct opposite to “in succession,”
when each ship changes direction as she comes to the spot
in which the leading ship has turned—<i>i.e.</i> follows her.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> A flag-sub-lieutenant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Japanese officers said that after Port Arthur had
capitulated, while waiting for the Baltic fleet, they worked
up to their high state of preparation as follows:—At target
practice every gun captain fired five live shells out of his
gun. New guns were afterwards substituted for those
worn out.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> According to thoroughly trustworthy reports, the
Japanese in the battle of Tsu-shima were the first to
employ a new kind of explosive in their shells, the
secret of which they bought during the war from its
inventor, a colonel in one of the South American
Republics. It was said that these shells could only be
used in guns of large calibre in the armoured squadrons,
and that is how those of our ships engaged with Admiral
Kataoka’s squadron did not suffer the same amount of
damage, or have so many fires, as the ships engaged
with the battleships and armoured cruisers. Very
convincing proofs of this were the cases of the <i>Svietlana</i>
and <i>Donskoy</i>. On 28th May the former was subjected
to the fire of two light cruisers, and the latter to the
fire of five. In the first place, both were able to hold
out for a considerable time, and in the second (and this
is most important), they did not catch fire, although on
both ships—the <i>Donskoy</i>, which was one of the older
type, and the <i>Svietlana</i>, which was like a yacht—there
was considerably more combustible material than on
the newer type of battleship.
</p>
<p>
For a great many years in naval gunnery two distinct
ideas have prevailed—one is to inflict on the enemy,
although not necessarily much (in quantity), severe and
heavy damage—<i>i.e.</i> to stop movement—to penetrate
under the water-line—to get a burst in the hull below
the water-line—briefly, to put the ship at once out of
action. The other is to pour upon him the greatest
volume of fire in the shortest time—though it be above
water and the actual damage caused by each individual
shot be immaterial—in the hope of paralysing the ship,
trusting that if this were done it would not be difficult
to destroy her completely—that she would, in fact, sink
by herself.
</p>
<p>
With modern guns, in order to secure the first of the
above ideas, solid armour-penetrating projectiles must
be employed—<i>i.e.</i> thick-coated shells (whose internal
capacity and bursting charge is consequently diminished),
and percussion fuzes with retarded action, bursting the
shell inside the target. To secure the second idea
shells need only be sufficiently solid to ensure their
not bursting at the moment of being fired. The thickness
of their walls may be reduced to the minimum,
and their internal capacity and bursting charge increased
to the utmost limits. The percussion fuses should be
sensitive enough to detonate at the slightest touch.
</p>
<p>
The first of the above views prevails chiefly in France,
the second in England. In the late war we held the
first, and the Japanese the second.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> A colonel of the marine artillery—flag gunnery officer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> By the Admiral’s order the iron oil drums, instead
of being thrown away, had been converted into buckets,
and these home-made contrivances were placed about the
decks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> In the Battle of Tsu-shima the Japanese losses were:
</p>

<table class="narrow" summary="Japanese losses">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Killed</td>
    <td class="tdr">113</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Dangerously wounded</td>
    <td class="tdr">139</td></tr>

    <td class="tdr">243</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Slightly wounded</td>
    <td class="tdr">42</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">These figures are sufficiently eloquent, even allowing for
the reports of Japanese officers to be somewhat partial.
Almost half of the casualties (252 out of 537) were killed
and dangerously wounded, the other half were severely
and slightly wounded—less than 8 per cent. The total
number was insignificant. Our shells evidently either
never burst, or burst badly, <i>i.e.</i> in a few large pieces.
The Japanese bursting charge was seven times stronger
than ours, and consisted not of pyroxylene, but of shimose
(and perhaps of something still more powerful). Shimose,
on exploding, raises the temperature one and a half times
higher than pyroxylene. In fact, one might say that a
Japanese shell bursting well did as much damage as
twelve of ours bursting equally well. And this ours
rarely succeeded in doing!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The ships nearest to us reported afterwards that the
armoured shield on our after turret had been blown right
up above the bridges, and then was seen to fall crumpled
up on to the poop. What had actually happened was not
known.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> In order to establish a connection between the facts
which I personally saw and noted down, and in order
to be able to explain the Japanese movements, I shall
have recourse to sources which can hardly be suspected
of partiality towards us. I refer to two Japanese official
publications which are both entitled “Nippon-Kai Tai-Kai-Sen”
(“The Great Battle in the Sea of Japan”). The
books are illustrated by a number of photographs and
plans taken at different moments of the fight, and contain
the reports of various ships and detachments. A few
quite immaterial differences in description of detail by
various witnesses have not been removed, as they only
give the stamp of truth to the publication.
</p>
<p>
I must request my readers to excuse the heavy, and
at times incoherent language introduced by me in these
quotations. The reason for this is my wish to keep as
near as possible to the original, and, in the construction
of its sentences, Japanese is totally different to any
European language.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> In a ship there is no proper church compartment. The
church is only rigged when a service is to be held.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> There were probably more here than in the whole of
the Japanese fleet.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Whether this turn was intentional or accidental,
owing to the damage done to her steering communicators,
will for ever remain a secret.</p></div>

is spoken.—A.B.L.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Of all the wounded members of the staff, who were
below, under the armoured deck, it was only possible to
“collect” two—Filipinoffsky and Leontieff. The former
was in the lower fighting position, which was hermetically
separated from the mess deck, and received a current of
fresh air through the armoured tube of the conning
tower. (All the same he had to sit by candle light, as the
lamps had gone out.) The latter was at the exit hatch.
The mess deck was in darkness (the electric light had
gone out) and was full of suffocating smoke. Hurrying
along to find the staff, we called them by name; but
received no answers. The silence of the dead reigned
in that smoky darkness, and it is probable that all who
were in the closed compartments under the armoured
deck, where the ventilators took smoke instead of air,
gradually becoming suffocated, lost consciousness and died.
The engines had ceased to work. The electric light had
given out for want of steam; and no one came up from
below. Of the 900 men composing the complement of the
<i>Suvoroff</i>, it would not be far wrong to say that, at this
time there remained alive only those few who were
gathered together in the lower battery and on the windward
embrasure.</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
